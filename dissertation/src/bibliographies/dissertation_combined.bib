  abstract = {In neuroscience, experimental designs in which multiple observations are collected from a single research object (for example, multiple neurons from one animal) are common: 53\% of 314 reviewed papers from five renowned journals included this type of data. These so-called 'nested designs' yield data that cannot be considered to be independent, and so violate the independency assumption of conventional statistical methods such as the t test. Ignoring this dependency results in a probability of incorrectly concluding that an effect is statistically significant that is far higher (up to 80\%) than the nominal {$\alpha$} level (usually set at 5\%). We discuss the factors affecting the type I error rate and the statistical power in nested data, methods that accommodate dependency between observations and ways to determine the optimal study design when data are nested. Notably, optimization of experimental designs nearly always concerns collection of more truly independent observations, rather than more observations from one research object.},

We examined how visual speech (lip-movements) transforms phonetic representations, indexed by changes to the N1 auditory evoked potential (AEP). EEG was acquired while human subjects watched and listened to videos of a speaker uttering consonant vowel (CV) syllables, /ba/ and /wa/, presented in auditory-only, AV congruent or incongruent contexts, or in a context in which the consonants were replaced by white noise (noise-replaced). Subjects reported whether they heard 'ba' or 'wa'. We hypothesized that the auditory N1 amplitude during illusory perception (caused by incongruent AV input, like in the McGurk illusion, or white noise-replaced consonants in CV utterances) should shift to reflect the auditory N1 characteristics of the phonemes conveyed visually (by mouth movements) as opposed to acoustically. Indeed, the N1 AEP became l...},

The strong feelings derive from a political story, often heatedly disavowed by technologists but widespread in the culture: P2P delivers on the Internet's promise of decentralization.

  abstract = {The ability to simultaneously image the spatiotemporal activity signatures from many neurons during unrestrained vertebrate behaviors has become possible through the development of miniaturized fluorescence microscopes, or miniscopes, sufficiently light to be carried by small animals such as bats, birds and rodents. Miniscopes have permitted the study of circuits underlying song vocalization, action sequencing, head-direction tuning, spatial memory encoding and sleep to name a few. The foundation for these microscopes has been laid over the last two decades through academic research with some of this work resulting in commercialization. More recently, open-source initiatives have led to an even broader adoption of miniscopes in the neuroscience community. Open-source designs allow for rapid modification and extension of their function, which has resulted in a new generation of miniscopes that now permit wire-free or wireless recording, concurrent electrophysiology and imaging, two-color fluorescence detection, simultaneous optical actuation and read-out as well as wide-field and volumetric light-field imaging. These novel miniscopes will further expand the toolset of those seeking affordable methods to probe neural circuit function during naturalistic behaviors. Here, we will discuss the early development, present use and future potential of miniscopes.},

Simple measures such as the frequency response area or frequency tuning curve provide little insight into the function of the auditory cortex in complex sound environments. Spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) models, despite their descriptive potential, perform poorly when used to predict auditory cortical responses, showing that nonlinear features of cortical response functions, which are not captured by STRFs, are functionally important. We introduce a new approach to the description of auditory cortical responses, using multilinear modeling methods. These descriptions simultaneously account for several nonlinearities in the stimulus-response functions of auditory cortical neurons, including adaptation, spectral interactions, and nonlinear sensitivity to sound level. The models reveal multiple inseparabilities in cortical processing of time lag, frequency, and sound level, and suggest functional mechanisms by which auditory cortical neurons are sensitive to stimulus context. By explicitly modeling these contextual influences, the models are able to predict auditory cortical responses more accurately than are STRF models. In addition, they can explain some forms of stimulus dependence in STRFs that were previously poorly understood.},

As questions asked of behaviour and brain activity become more sophisticated, the ability to specify and run richly structured tasks becomes more important. An increasing focus on reproducibility also necessitates accurate communication of task logic to other researchers. To these ends, we developed pyControl, a system of open-source hardware and software for controlling behavioural experiments comprising a simple yet flexible Python-based syntax for specifying tasks as extended state machines, hardware modules for building behavioural setups, and a graphical user interface designed for efficiently running high-throughput experiments on many setups in parallel, all with extensive online documentation. These tools make it quicker, easier, and cheaper to implement rich behavioural tasks at scale. As important, pyControl facilitates communication and reproducibility of behavioural experiments through a highly readable task definition syntax and self-documenting features. Here, we outline the system's design and rationale, present validation experiments characterising system performance, and demonstrate example applications in freely moving and head-fixed mouse behaviour.},

Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer \textendash{} a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformers outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud's recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So let's try to break the model apart and look at how it functions. The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard's NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter. 2020 Update: I've created a ``Narrated Transformer'' video which is a gentler approach to the topic: A High-Level Look Let's begin by looking at the model as a single black box.

Sequence-to-sequence models are deep learning models that have achieved a lot of success in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. Google Translate started using such a model in production in late 2016. These models are explained in the two pioneering papers (Sutskever et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2014). I found, however, that understanding the model well enough to implement it requires unraveling a series of concepts that build on top of each other. I thought that a bunch of these ideas would be more accessible if expressed visually. That's what I aim to do in this post. You'll need some previous understanding of deep learning to get through this post. I hope it can be a useful companion to reading the papers mentioned above (and the attention papers linked later in the post).

  abstract = {The RDF graph-based data model has seen ever-broadening adoption in recent years, prompting the standardization of the SPARQL query language for RDF, and the development of local and distributed engines for processing SPARQL queries. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of techniques, engines and benchmarks for querying RDF knowledge graphs. While other reviews on this topic tend to focus on the distributed setting, the main focus of the work is on providing a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art storage, indexing and query processing techniques for efficiently evaluating SPARQL queries in a local setting (on one machine). To keep the survey self-contained, we also provide a short discussion on graph partitioning techniques used in the distributed setting. We conclude by discussing contemporary research challenges for further improving SPARQL query engines. An online extended version also provides a survey of over one hundred SPARQL query engines and the techniques they use, along with twelve benchmarks and their features.},

  abstract = {Modern tools for biological research, especially microscopy, have rapidly advanced in recent years, which has led to the generation of increasingly large amounts of data on a regular basis. The result is that scientists desperately need state-of-the-art technical infrastructure for raw data storage, transfer, and processing. These scientists currently rely on outdated ways to move and store data, costing valuable time and risking loss of valuable data. While the community is aware of modern approaches to data management and high-level principles (including FAIR), highly-trained and highly-paid scientists are forced to spend time dealing with technical problems, which can ultimately costs more than providing storage and a fast network on campus. Here we provide concise arguments for better infrastructure, blueprints of possible solutions, and advice in navigating the political process of solving this issue. We suggest, as a broad solution, separate NIH-managed fund for supporting universities and institutes in deployment of data storage and long-term data sharing for all funded projects. This position statement is open for more contributors from imaging, life sciences, and other disciplines. Please contact us with your experience and perspective.},

Peer-to-peer architectures are characterized by their ability to adapt to failures and accommodate transient populations of nodes while maintaining acceptable connectivity and performance.Content distribution is an important peer-to-peer application on the Internet that has received considerable research attention. Content distribution applications typically allow personal computers to function in a coordinated manner as a distributed storage medium by contributing, searching, and obtaining digital content.In this survey, we propose a framework for analyzing peer-to-peer content distribution technologies. Our approach focuses on nonfunctional characteristics such as security, scalability, performance, fairness, and resource management potential, and examines the way in which these characteristics are reflected in---and affected by---the architectural design decisions adopted by current peer-to-peer systems.We study current peer-to-peer systems and infrastructure technologies in terms of their distributed object location and routing mechanisms, their approach to content replication, caching and migration, their support for encryption, access control, authentication and identity, anonymity, deniability, accountability and reputation, and their use of resource trading and management schemes.},

Recent work in auditory neuroscience has made substantial progress in studying how sounds are represented in the auditory system under different contexts, demonstrating that auditory processing of seemingly simple acoustic features, such as frequency and time, is highly dependent on co-occurring acoustic and behavioral stimuli. Through a combination of electrophysiological recordings, computational analysis and behavioral techniques, recent research identified the interactions between external spectral and temporal context of stimuli, as well as the internal behavioral state.},

"Role of dynamic information in the perception of coarticulated vowels," Ph.D. thesis, University of Connecticut, Standford, CT] demonstrated that nonspeech contexts had no influence on pitch judgments of nonspeech targets, whereas context effects were obtained when instructed to perceive the sounds as speech. On the other hand, Holt et al. [(2000). "Neighboring spectral content influences vowel identification," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 108, 710-722] showed that nonspeech contexts were sufficient to elicit context effects in speech targets. The current study was to test a hypothesis that could explain the varying effectiveness of nonspeech contexts: Context effects are obtained only when there are well-established perceptual categories for the target stimuli. Experiment 1 examined context effects in speech and nonspeech signals using four series of stimuli: steady-state vowels that perceptually spanned from /inverted ohm/-/I/ in isolation and in the context of /w/ (with no steady-state portion) and two nonspeech sine-wave series that mimicked the acoustics of the speech series. In agreement with previous work context effects were obtained for speech contexts and targets but not for nonspeech analogs. Experiment 2 tested predictions of the hypothesis by testing for nonspeech context effects after the listeners had been trained to categorize the sounds. Following training, context-dependent categorization was obtained for nonspeech stimuli in the training group. These results are presented within a general perceptual-cognitive framework for speech perception research.},

Success in information-integration tasks requires a form of procedural learning and is sensitive to the nature and timing of feedback.

  abstract = {Classical models of perceptual decision-making assume that animals use a single, consistent strategy to integrate sensory evidence and form decisions during an experiment. Here we provide analyses showing that this common view is incorrect. We use a latent variable modeling framework to show that decision-making behavior in mice reflects an interplay between different strategies that alternate on a timescale of tens to hundreds of trials. This model provides a powerful alternate explanation for ``lapses'' commonly observed during psychophysical experiments. Formally, our approach consists of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with states corresponding to different decision-making strategies, each parameterized by a distinct Bernoulli generalized linear model (GLM). We fit the resulting model (GLM-HMM) to choice data from two large cohorts of mice in different perceptual decision-making tasks. For both datasets, we found that mouse decision-making was far better described by a GLM-HMM with 3 or 4 states than by a traditional psychophysical model with lapses. The identified states were highly consistent across animals, consisting of a single ``engaged'' state, in which the strategy relied heavily on the sensory stimulus, and multiple biased or disengaged states in which accuracy was low. These states persisted for many trials, suggesting that lapses were not independent, but reflected state dynamics in which animals were relatively engaged or disengaged for extended periods of time. We found that for most animals, response times and violation rates were positively correlated with disengagement, providing independent correlates of the identified changes in strategy. The GLM-HMM framework thus provides a powerful lens for the analysis of decision-making, and suggests that standard measures of psychophysical performance mask the presence of slow but dramatic alternations in strategy across trials.},

We are at a critical juncture where there is a pressing need for the academic community \textendash{} individually and collectively \textendash{} to make thoughtful and deliberate decisions about what and whom to support \textendash{} and under what terms and conditions. These decisions will determine who ultimately controls the research and education process; and whether we meaningfully address inequities created by legacy players or simply recreate them in new ways. These decisions will shape libraries' role in the scholarly enterprise, now and for the future.},

  abstract = {Cortical receptive fields represent the signal preferences of sensory neurons. Receptive fields are thought to provide a representation of sensory experience from which the cerebral cortex may make interpretations. While it is essential to determine a neuron's receptive field, it remains unclear which features of the acoustic environment are specifically represented by neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI). We characterized cat AI spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) by finding both the spike-triggered average (STA) and stimulus dimensions that maximized the mutual information between response and stimulus. We derived a nonlinearity relating spiking to stimulus projection onto two maximally informative dimensions (MIDs). The STA was highly correlated with the first MID. Generally, the nonlinearity for the first MID was asymmetric and often monotonic in shape, while the second MID nonlinearity was symmetric and nonmonotonic. The joint nonlinearity for both MIDs revealed that most first and second MIDs were synergistic and thus should be considered conjointly. The difference between the nonlinearities suggests different possible roles for the MIDs in auditory processing.},

  abstract = {The receptive fields of many auditory cortical neurons are multidimensional and are best represented by more than one stimulus feature. The number of these dimensions, their characteristics, and how they differ with stimulus context have been relatively unexplored. Standard methods that are often used to characterize multidimensional stimulus selectivity, such as spike-triggered covariance (STC) or maximally informative dimensions (MIDs), are either limited to Gaussian stimuli or are only able to recover a small number of stimulus features due to data limitations. An information theoretic extension of STC, the maximum noise entropy (MNE) model, can be used with non-Gaussian stimulus distributions to find an arbitrary number of stimulus dimensions. When we applied the MNE model to auditory cortical neurons, we often found more than two stimulus features that influenced neuronal firing. Excitatory and suppressive features coded different acoustic contexts: excitatory features encoded higher temporal and spectral modulations, while suppressive features had lower modulation frequency preferences. We found that the excitatory and suppressive features themselves were sensitive to stimulus context when we employed two stimuli that differed only in their short-term correlation structure: while the linear features were similar, the secondary features were strongly affected by stimulus statistics. These results show that multidimensional receptive field processing is influenced by feature type and stimulus context.},

  abstract = {A series of experiments is reported that investigated the pattern of acoustic information specifying place and manner of stop consonants in medial position after [s]. In both production and perception, information for stop place includes the spectrum of the fricative at offset, the duration of the silent closure interval, the spectral relationship between the frequency of the stop release burst and the following periodically excited formants, and the spectral and temporal characteristics of the first formant transition. Similarly, the information for stop manner includes the duration of silent closure, the frequency of the first formant at the release, the magnitude of the first formant transition, and the proximity of the second and third formants at release. A relationship was shown to exist in perception between the spectral characteristics of the first formant and the duration of the silent closure required to hear a stop. This appears to reciprocate the covariation of these parameters in production across different places of articulation and different vocalic contexts. The existence of perceptual sensitivity to a wide range of the acoustic consequences of production questions the efficacy of accounts of speech perception in terms of the fractionation of the signal into elemental acoustic cues, which are then integrated to yield a phonetic percept. It is argued that it is inappropriate to ascribe a psychological status to cues whose only reality is their operational role as physical parameters whose manipulation can change the phenotic interpretation of a signal. It is suggested that the metric of the information for phonetic perception cannot be that of the cues; rather, a metric should be sought in which acoustic and articulatory dynamics are isomorphic.},

Within DCMI, however, the emphasis has been less on growing this small vocabulary than on clarifying how the DCMI vocabulary can ``play well'' with other, complementary vocabularies in a Semantic Web that recombines semantics from multiple sources for specialized purposes. This priority has led DCMI to examine models for referencing other vocabularies and to clarify the modeling bases for interoperability among heterogeneous systems.},

  abstract = {Typical systems neuroscience experiments correlate the activity of recorded neurons with controlled variations in stimuli or behavior. Such experiments are commonly taken to reveal that the neural activity is a representation of the stimulus or behavior. But what does this statement mean? Representation is a philosophical concept with a rich history going back at least to Aristotle. A careful reading of contemporary philosophy suggests four criteria of representation as they relate to neuroscience. First, a representation needs to correlate with the object in reality that it represents. Second, a representation needs to have some causal impact on behavior. Third, a representation should have its causal role exclusively -- the absence of the representation should block the behavior it enables. Fourth, a representation should have teleological justification that specifies the cases in which it is a misrepresentation. We argue that not taking all four criteria seriously leads to statements that are neither neuroscientifically nor philosophically satisfying. We discuss how neuroscience can move towards a deeper notion of representation.},

Throughout the nineteenth century and into much of the twentieth, external referee reports were considered an optional part of journal editing or grant making. The idea that refereeing is a requirement for scientific legitimacy seems to have arisen first in the Cold War United States. In the 1970s, in the wake of a series of attacks on scientific funding, American scientists faced a dilemma: there was increasing pressure for science to be accountable to those who funded it, but scientists wanted to ensure their continuing influence over funding decisions. Scientists and their supporters cast expert refereeing\textemdash or ``peer review,'' as it was increasingly called\textemdash as the crucial process that ensured the credibility of science as a whole. Taking funding decisions out of expert hands, they argued, would be a corruption of science itself. This public elevation of peer review both reinforced and spread the belief that only peer-reviewed science was scientifically legitimate.},

The payoff for a distributed configuration in terms of survivability in the cases of enemy attack directed against nodes, links or combinations of nodes and links is demonstrated. A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity propagates across spatial scales in the mammalian cortex but technical challenges have generally precluded establishing conceptual links between the function of local circuits of neurons and brain-wide network dynamics. To solve this problem, we developed a method for simultaneous cellular-resolution two-photon calcium imaging of a local microcircuit and mesoscopic widefield calcium imaging of the entire cortical mantle in awake, behaving mice. Our method employs an orthogonal axis design whereby the mesoscopic objective is oriented downward directly above the brain and the two-photon objective is oriented horizontally, with imaging performed through a glass right angle microprism implanted in the skull. In support of this method, we introduce a suite of analysis tools for relating the activity of individual cells to distal cortical areas, as well as a viral method for robust and widespread gene delivery in the juvenile mouse brain. We use these methods to characterize the diversity of associations of individual, genetically-defined neurons with cortex-wide network motifs.},

The Protocol Activity Markup Language (PAML) is a free and open protocol representation aiming to address this gap, building on a foundation of UML, Autoprotocol, and SBOL RDF. PAML provides a representation both for protocols and for records of their execution and the resulting data, as well as a framework for exporting from PAML for execution by either humans or laboratory automation. PAML is currently implemented in the form of an RDF knowledge representation, specification document, and Python library, can be exported for execution as either a manual ``paper protocol'' or Autoprotocol, and is being further developed as an open community effort.},

  abstract = {The complexity of many biological, social and technological systems stems from the richness of the interactions among their units. Over the past decades, a great variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, in face-to-face human communication, chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be simply described just in terms of simple dyads. Until recently, little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can greatly enhance our modeling capacities and help us to understand and predict their emerging dynamical behaviors. Here, we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We first discuss the methods to represent higher-order interactions and give a unified presentation of the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed in the literature to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing simplicial complexes, bipartite graphs and hypergraphs. We introduce and discuss the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and on dynamical topology. We focus on novel emergent phenomena characterizing landmark dynamical processes, such as diffusion, spreading, synchronization and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions. We elucidate the relations between higher-order topology and dynamical properties, and conclude with a summary of empirical applications, providing an outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers.},

To test the nature of individual face representations, a linear continuum of ``morphed'' faces was generated between individual exemplars of familiar faces. In separate categorization, discrimination and ``better-likeness'' tasks, subjects viewed pairs of faces from these continua. Subjects discriminate most accurately when face-pairs straddle apparent category boundaries; thus individual faces are perceived categorically. A high correlation is found between the familiarity of a face-pair and the magnitude of the categorization effect. Categorical perception therefore is not limited to low-level perceptual continua, but can occur at higher levels and may be acquired through experience as well.},

This computation comes up in seemingly unrelated tasks, including causal reasoning, odor recognition, motor control, visual tracking, coordinate transformations, visual search, decision making, and object recognition, to name just a few. The question we address here is: how could neural circuits implement such marginalizations? We show that when spike trains exhibit a particular type of statistics\textemdash associated with constant Fano factors and gain-invariant tuning curves, as is often reported in vivo\textemdash some of the more common marginalizations can be achieved with networks that implement a quadratic nonlinearity and divisive normalization, the latter being a type of nonlinear lateral inhibition that has been widely reported in neural circuits. Previous studies have implicated divisive normalization in contrast gain control and attentional modulation. Our results raise the possibility that it is involved in yet another, highly critical, computation: near optimal marginalization in a remarkably wide range of tasks.},

How the connectivity structure of a network determines the emergent dynamical system however remains to be clarified. Here we consider a novel class of models, Gaussian-mixture low-rank recurrent networks, in which the rank of the connectivity matrix and the number of statistically-defined populations are independent hyper-parameters. We show that the resulting collective dynamics form a dynamical system, where the rank sets the dimensionality and the population structure shapes the dynamics. In particular, the collective dynamics can be described in terms of a simplified effective circuit of interacting latent variables. While having a single, global population strongly restricts the possible dynamics, we demonstrate that if the number of populations is large enough, a rank-R network can approximate any R-dimensional dynamical system.},

Although the perception of speaker-related features of voice plays a major role in human communication, little is known about its neural basis. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human volunteers, that voice-selective regions can be found bilaterally along the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). These regions showed greater neuronal activity when subjects listened passively to vocal sounds, whether speech or non-speech, than to non-vocal environmental sounds. Central STS regions also displayed a high degree of selectivity by responding significantly more to vocal sounds than to matched control stimuli, including scrambled voices and amplitude-modulated noise. Moreover, their response to stimuli degraded by frequency filtering paralleled the subjects' behavioural performance in voice-perception tasks that used these stimuli. The voice-selective areas in the STS may represent the counterpart of the face-selective areas in human visual cortex; their existence sheds new light on the functional architecture of the human auditory cortex.},

Coherence peaked at the choice point, most strongly after task rule acquisition. Simultaneously, Pfc pyramidal neurons reorganized their phase, concentrating at hippocampal theta trough, and synchronous cell assemblies emerged. This synchronous state may result from increased inhibition exerted by interneurons on pyramidal cells, as measured by cross-correlation, and could be modulated by dopamine: we found similar hippocampal-Pfc theta coherence increases and neuronal phase shifts following local administration of dopamine in Pfc of anesthetized rats. Pfc cell assemblies emerging during high coherence were preferentially replayed during subsequent sleep, concurrent with hippocampal sharp waves. Thus, hippocampal/prefrontal coherence could lead to synchronization of reward predicting activity in prefrontal networks, tagging it for subsequent memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Speech perception requires the effortless mapping from smooth, seemingly continuous changes in sound features into discrete perceptual units, a conversion exemplified in the phenomenon of categorical perception. Explaining how/when the human brain performs this acoustic-phonetic transformation remains an elusive problem in current models and theories of speech perception. In previous attempts to decipher the neural basis of speech perception, it is often unclear whether the alleged brain correlates reflect an underlying percept or merely changes in neural activity that covary with parameters of the stimulus. Here, we recorded neuroelectric activity generated at both cortical and subcortical levels of the auditory pathway elicited by a speech vowel continuum whose percept varied categorically from /u/ to /a/. This integrative approach allows us to characterize how various auditory structures code, transform, and ultimately render the perception of speech material as well as dissociate brain responses reflecting changes in stimulus acoustics from those that index true internalized percepts. We find that activity from the brainstem mirrors properties of the speech waveform with remarkable fidelity, reflecting progressive changes in speech acoustics but not the discrete phonetic classes reported behaviorally. In comparison, patterns of late cortical evoked activity contain information reflecting distinct perceptual categories and predict the abstract phonetic speech boundaries heard by listeners. Our findings demonstrate a critical transformation in neural speech representations between brainstem and early auditory cortex analogous to an acoustic-phonetic mapping necessary to generate categorical speech percepts. Analytic modeling demonstrates that a simple nonlinearity accounts for the transformation between early (subcortical) brain activity and subsequent cortical/behavioral responses to speech ({$>$}. 150-200. ms) thereby describing a plausible mechanism by which the brain achieves its acoustic-to-phonetic mapping. Results provide evidence that the neurophysiological underpinnings of categorical speech are present cortically by \textasciitilde. 175. ms after sound enters the ear. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

  abstract = {Neuronal plasticity that develops in the cortex during learning is assumed to represent memory content, but the functions of such plasticity are actually unknown. The shift in spectral tuning in primary auditory cortex (A1) to the frequency of a tone signal is a compelling candidate for a substrate of memory because it has all of the cardinal attributes of associative memory: associativity, specificity, rapid induction, consolidation, and long-term retention. Tuning shifts increase the representational area of the signal in A1, as an increasing function of performance level, suggesting that area encodes the magnitude of acquired stimulus significance. The present study addresses the question of the specific function of learning-induced associative representational plasticity. We tested the hypothesis that specific increases in A1 representational area for an auditory signal serve the mnemonic function of enhancing memory strength for that signal. Rats were trained to bar-press for reward contingent on the presence of a signal tone (5.0 kHz), and assessed for memory strength during extinction. The amount of representational area gain for the signal frequency band was significantly positively correlated with resistance to extinction to the signal frequency in two studies that spanned the range of task difficulty. These findings indicate that specific gain in cortical representational area underlies the strength of the behaviorally-relevant contents of memory. Thus, mnemonic functions of cortical plasticity are determinable.},

This paper reports on a qualitative study of cyberinfrastructure development in the emerging field of metagenomics to illustrate some of the issues that can arise when cyberinfrastructures are faced with new scientific communities, practices, and research questions. New science inevitably brings new forms of data, new analysis tools, and the need to recontextualize existing data. Cyberinfrastructures must be prepared to adapt to the new scientific context. In this study, developers employed three strategies for addressing new scientific requirements: work-arounds, extensions, and from-scratch development. These strategies are informed by the tension between fitting the CI to the needs of a specific community and maintaining interoperability across systems.},

  abstract = {The areas of the brain that encode color categorically have not yet been reliably identified. Here, we used functional MRI adaptation to identify neuronal populations that represent color categories irrespective of metric differences in color. Two colors were successively presented within a block of trials. The two colors were either from the same or different categories (e.g., "blue 1 and blue 2" or "blue 1 and green 1"), and the size of the hue difference was varied. Participants performed a target detection task unrelated to the difference in color. In the middle frontal gyrus of both hemispheres and to a lesser extent, the cerebellum, blood-oxygen level-dependent response was greater for colors from different categories relative to colors from the same category. Importantly, activation in these regions was not modulated by the size of the hue difference, suggesting that neurons in these regions represent color categorically, regardless of metric color difference. Representational similarity analyses, which investigated the similarity of the pattern of activity across local groups of voxels, identified other regions of the brain (including the visual cortex), which responded to metric but not categorical color differences. Therefore, categorical and metric hue differences appear to be coded in qualitatively different ways and in different brain regions. These findings have implications for the long-standing debate on the origin and nature of color categories, and also further our understanding of how color is processed by the brain.},

  abstract = {We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1\% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

Indeed, recent studies support the existence of anatomically segregated "what" and "where" cortical processing streams. However, few attempts have been made to measure the responses of individual neurons in different cortical fields to sounds that vary simultaneously across spatial and nonspatial dimensions. We recorded responses to artificial vowels presented in virtual acoustic space to investigate the representations of pitch, timbre, and sound source azimuth in both core and belt areas of ferret auditory cortex. A variance decomposition technique was used to quantify the way in which altering each parameter changed neural responses. Most units were sensitive to two or more of these stimulus attributes. Although indicating that neural encoding of pitch, location, and timbre cues is distributed across auditory cortex, significant differences in average neuronal sensitivity were observed across cortical areas and depths, which could form the basis for the segregation of spatial and nonspatial cues at higher cortical levels. Some units exhibited significant nonlinear interactions between particular combinations of pitch, timbre, and azimuth. These interactions were most pronounced for pitch and timbre and were less commonly observed between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Such nonlinearities were most prevalent in primary auditory cortex, although they tended to be small compared with stimulus main effects.},

  abstract = {Successful perception depends on combining sensory input with prior knowledge. However, the underlying mechanism by which these two sources of information are combined is unknown. In speech perception, as in other domains, two functionally distinct coding schemes have been proposed for how expectations influence representation of sensory evidence. Traditional models suggest that expected features of the speech input are enhanced or sharpened via interactive activation (Sharpened Signals). Conversely, Predictive Coding suggests that expected features are suppressed so that unexpected features of the speech input (Prediction Errors) are processed further. The present work is aimed at distinguishing between these two accounts of how prior knowledge influences speech perception. By combining behavioural, univariate, and multivariate fMRI measures of how sensory detail and prior expectations influence speech perception with computational modelling, we provide evidence in favour of Prediction Error computations. Increased sensory detail and informative expectations have additive behavioural and univariate neural effects because they both improve the accuracy of word report and reduce the BOLD signal in lateral temporal lobe regions. However, sensory detail and informative expectations have interacting effects on speech representations shown by multivariate fMRI in the posterior superior temporal sulcus. When prior knowledge was absent, increased sensory detail enhanced the amount of speech information measured in superior temporal multivoxel patterns, but with informative expectations, increased sensory detail reduced the amount of measured information. Computational simulations of Sharpened Signals and Prediction Errors during speech perception could both explain these behavioural and univariate fMRI observations. However, the multivariate fMRI observations were uniquely simulated by a Prediction Error and not a Sharpened Signal model. The interaction between prior expectation and sensory detail provides evidence for a Predictive Coding account of speech perception. Our work establishes methods that can be used to distinguish representations of Prediction Error and Sharpened Signals in other perceptual domains.},

Whereas a definition for a P2P database system can be readily provided, a comparison with the more established decentralized models, commonly referred to as distributed, federated and multi-databases, is more likely to provide a better insight to this new P2P data management technology. Thus, in the paper, by distinguishing between db-centric and P2P-centric features, we examine features common to these database systems as well as other ad-hoc features that solely characterize P2P databases. We also provide a non-exhaustive taxonomy of the most prominent research efforts toward the realization of full-fledged P2P databases.},

  abstract = {SummaryThe insufficiency of terminological standards in neuroscience is increasingly recognized as a serious obstacle to interoperability. Adoption of a controlled vocabulary is a successful solution for small numbers of groups that work closely together but is impractical for large numbers of groups who represent diverse areas of research, index information by various legitimate nomenclatures, or publish in different languages. Interoperability among such disparate databases requires a translation mechanism, or ``mediator,'' to enable communication and data sharing among databases. Shared ontologies are essential components of a mediator. An ontology codifies the relations between terms of multiple nomenclatures and the concepts they represent. Neuroanatomy is central to neuroscience, and neuroanatomical terminology represents a core portion of the vocabulary of neuroscience. We have created in NeuroNames an ontology of 2500 neuroanatomical concepts referenced by 15,000 terms in seven languages. NeuroNames is the mediator for BrainInfo, a portal to neuroanatomy on the Web. We hope that a description of our experience in establishing interoperability between BrainInfo and other neuroscience Web sites may be useful to others engaged in the development of ontologies for neuroscience.},

These are elements associated with the internet and, frequently today, associated with cyberinfrastructure or e-science endeavors. We argue that a theoretical understanding of infrastructure provides the context for needed dialogue between design, use, and sustainability of internet-based infrastructure services. This article outlines a research area and outlines overarching themes of Infrastructure Studies. Part one of the paper presents definitions for infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure, reviewing salient previous work. Part two portrays key ideas from infrastructure studies (knowledge work, social and political values, new forms of sociality, etc.). In closing, the character of the field today is considered.},

The underlying common assumption is that only the best scientists manage to publish in a highly selective tier of the most prestigious journals. However, data from several lines of evidence suggest that the methodological quality of scientific experiments does not increase with increasing rank of the journal. On the contrary, an accumulating body of evidence suggests the inverse: methodological quality and, consequently, reliability of published research works in several fields may be decreasing with increasing journal rank. The data supporting these conclusions circumvent confounding factors such as increased readership and scrutiny for these journals, focusing instead on quantifiable indicators of methodological soundness in the published literature, relying on, in part, semi-automated data extraction from often thousands of publications at a time. With the accumulating evidence over the last decade grew the realization that the very existence of scholarly journals, due to their inherent hierarchy, constitutes one of the major threats to publicly funded science: hiring, promoting and funding scientists who publish unreliable science eventually erodes public trust in science.},

  abstract = {A major factor underlying several of scholarship's most pressing problems is its antiquated journal system with its trifecta of reproducibility, affordability and functionality crises. Any solution needs to not only solve the current problems but also be capable of preventing a takeover by corporations. Technically, there is broad agreement on the goal for a modern scholarly digital infrastructure: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies of current journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding further vendor lock-in. Redirection of funding from the legacy publishers to the new framework may be realized by a tried-and-tested incentive system: Funding agencies have ensured minimum standards at funded institutions by requiring specific infrastructures. These requirements, updated to include the new framework, provide exquisite incentives for institutions to redirect their infrastructure funds from antiquated journals to modern technology. At the same time and enabled by this plan, new, modern and adaptable reputation systems, long demanded by the scientific community, can finally be implemented. Ownership involves socially recognized economic rights, first and foremost the exclusive control over that property, with the self-efficacy it affords. The inability to exert such control over crucial components of their scholarly infrastructure in the face of a generally recognized need for action for over three decades now, evinces the dramatic erosion of real ownership rights for the scholarly community over said infrastructure. Thus, this proposal is motivated not only by the now very urgent need to restore such ownership to the scholarly community, but also by the understanding that through their funding bodies, scholars may have an effective and proven avenue at their disposal to identify game-changing actions and to design a financial incentive structure for recipient institutions that can help realize the restoration of ownership, with the goal to implement open digital infrastructures that are as effective and as invisible as their non-digital counterparts.},

  abstract = {This special issue of the Journal of Neurobiology is devoted to a consideration of the avian song control system. In the 20 years that have passed since Nottebohm et al. 1976) first identified forebrain circuits that control song in birds, the song system has emerged as a leading model in behavioral neuroscience. To mark the beginning of the third decade of study of this model, we invited several leading investigators to contribute to this volume. We set two goals for the authors: to review progress in their area of study and, more important, to identify critical directions for future research. The modern study of birdsong began with the work of William Thorpe (1958, 1961). He showed that chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) collected as nestlings and reared in the laboratory in isolation from conspecific adult males produced very abnormal songs. If these young birds were exposed to tape recordings of wild chaffinch songs, however, they eventually produced normal songs that matched those heard on the recordings. These studies demonstrated for the first time that young birds must learn the song of their species by listening to adult conspecifics. Thorpe's student Peter Marler greatly expanded upon this early work. Marler and his colleagues demonstrated the existence of local geographic song "dialects," that song learning is characterized by early sensitive periods, and that birds have innate predispositions to learn the song of their species. Masakazu Konishi, while a student with Marler, showed that birds must be able to hear themselves sing to develop song normally. Fernando Nottebohm, also while a student with Marler, showed that the peripheral control of song production is lateralized. Nottebohm and his colleagues subsequently identified neural circuits in the avian forebrain that control song behavior. This important discovery paved the way for many investigators who have subsequently contributed to our understanding of song behavior and its neural control. The birdsong system offers several advantages as a model for identifying neural mechanisms that underlie biologically relevant behavior: 1. Song is a learned behavior that is controlled by discrete neural circuits. 2. There are distinct phases in the development of song, with well-defined sensitive periods. One can relate the ontogeny of song behavior to the development of the underlying neural circuits. 3. Song is the product of stereotyped motor programs, with hierarchical organization of the premotor and motor nuclei. 4. Song behavior and the associated neural circuits are sexually dimorphic in most species. 5. Gonadal steroid hormones have pronounced effects on the development and adult function of the song control circuits, as well as on song behavior. 6. There is extensive plasticity of the adult song system, including ongoing neurogenesis and seasonal changes in morphology. 7. There is pronounced species diversity in different aspects of song behavior, including the timing of vocal learning, sex patterns of song production, number of songs that are learned, and seasonality of song behavior. This diversity provides opportunities for comparative studies of the song control system.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Speech comprehension relies on the ability to understand the meaning of words within a coherent context. Recent studies have attempted to obtain electrophysiological indices of this process by modelling how brain activity is affected by a word9s semantic dissimilarity to preceding words. While the resulting indices appear robust and are strongly modulated by attention, it remains possible that, rather than capturing the contextual understanding of words, they may actually reflect word-to-word changes in semantic content without the need for a narrative-level understanding on the part of the listener. To test this possibility, we recorded EEG from subjects who listened to speech presented in either its original, narrative form, or after scrambling the word order by varying amounts. This manipulation affected the ability of subjects to comprehend the narrative content of the speech, but not the ability to recognize the individual words. Neural indices of semantic understanding and low-level acoustic processing were derived for each scrambling condition using the temporal response function (TRF) approach. Signatures of semantic processing were observed for conditions where speech was unscrambled or minimally scrambled and subjects were able to understand the speech. The same markers were absent for higher levels of scrambling when speech comprehension dropped below chance. In contrast, word recognition remained high and neural measures related to envelope tracking did not vary significantly across the different scrambling conditions. This supports the previous claim that electrophysiological indices based on the semantic dissimilarity of words to their context reflect a listener9s understanding of those words relative to that context. It also highlights the relative insensitivity of neural measures of low-level speech processing to speech comprehension.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {How do we make social justice the most pleasurable human experience? How can we awaken within ourselves desires that make it impossible to settle for anything less than a fulfilling life? Author and editor adrienne maree brown finds the answer in something she calls "pleasure activism," a politics of healing and happiness that explodes the dour myth that changing the world is just another form of work. Drawing on the black feminist tradition, she challenges us to rethink the ground rules of activism. Her mindset-altering essays are interwoven with conversations and insights from other feminist thinkers, including Audre Lorde, Joan Morgan, Cara Page, Sonya Renee Taylor, and Alexis Pauline Gumbs. Together they cover a wide array of subjects--from sex work to climate change, from race and gender to sex and drugs--building new narratives about how politics can feel good and how what feels good always has a complex politics of its own. Building on the success of her popular Emergent Strategy, brown launches a new series of the same name with this volume, bringing readers books that explore experimental, expansive, and innovative ways to meet the challenges that face our world today. Books that find the opportunity in every crisis!},

Confusion has arisen with regard to the usage of the related terms pure word deafness, auditory agnosia, and cortical deafness. Three new cases of word deafness are presented including one case with CT and necropsy correlation. These cases are compared with 34 previously reported cases of various cortical auditory disorders. Our review establishes that patients with word deafness who have had formal testing of linguistic and non-linguistic sound comprehension and musical abilities always demonstrated a more pervasive auditory agnosia. Despite the spectrum of auditory deficits and associated language abnormalities, patients with word deafness share common features including aetiology, pathology, clinical presentation and course. These common features justify inclusion of heterogeneous cortical auditory disorders under the rubric of word deafness. Despite some limitations the term "word deafness" should be retained for this syndrome, since inability to comprehend spoken words is the most distinctive clinical deficit. Word deafness is most frequently caused by cerebrovascular accidents of presumed cardiac embolisation, with bitemporal cortico-subcortical lesions. The sequence of cerebral injury is not predictive of resulting auditory deficits. Impairment of musical abilities parallels the severity of the auditory disorder.},

  abstract = {Summary Research in neuroscience increasingly relies on the mouse, a mammalian species that affords unparalleled genetic tractability and brain atlases. Here, we introduce high-yield methods for probing mouse visual decisions. Mice are head-fixed, facilitating repeatable visual stimulation, eye tracking, and brain access. They turn a steering wheel to make two alternative choices, forced or unforced. Learning is rapid thanks to intuitive coupling of stimuli to wheel position. The mouse decisions deliver high-quality psychometric curves for detection and discrimination and conform to the predictions of a simple probabilistic observer model. The task is readily paired with two-photon imaging of cortical activity. Optogenetic inactivation reveals that the task requires mice to use their visual cortex. Mice are motivated to perform the task by fluid reward or optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons. This stimulation elicits a larger number of trials and faster learning. These methods provide a platform to accurately probe mouse vision and its neural basis.},

ACQ4 has been used primarily for standard patch-clamp electrophysiology, laser scanning photostimulation, multiphoton microscopy, intrinsic imaging, and calcium imaging. The system is highly modular, which facilitates the addition of new devices and functionality. The modules included with ACQ4 provide for rapid construction of acquisition protocols, live video display, and customizable analysis tools. Position-aware data collection allows automated construction of image mosaics and registration of images with 3-dimensional anatomical atlases. ACQ4 uses free and open-source tools including Python, NumPy/SciPy for numerical computation, PyQt for the user interface, and PyQtGraph for scientific graphics. Supported hardware includes cameras, patch clamp amplifiers, scanning mirrors, lasers, shutters, Pockels cells, motorized stages, and more. ACQ4 is available for download at http://www.acq4.org.},

  abstract = {The auditory cortex of the cat is composed of 13 distinct fields that have been defined on the basis of anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Although an anatomically based hierarchical processing scheme has been proposed in auditory cortex, few functional studies have examined how these areas influence one another. The purpose of the present study was to examine the bidirectional processing contributions between primary auditory cortex (A1) and the nonprimary posterior auditory field (PAF). Multiunit acute recording techniques in eight mature cats were used to measure neuronal responses to tonal stimuli in A1 or PAF while synaptic activity from PAF or A1 was suppressed with reversible cooling deactivation techniques. Specifically, in four animals, electrophysiological recordings in A1 were conducted before, during, and after deactivation of PAF. Similarly, in the other four animals, PAF activity was measured before, during, and after deactivation of A1. The characteristic frequency, bandwidth, and neuronal threshold were calculated at each receptive field collected and the response strength and response latency measures were calculated from cumulative peristimulus time histograms. Two major changes in PAF response properties were observed during A1 deactivation: a decrease in response strength and a reduction in receptive field bandwidths. In comparison, we did not identify any significant changes in A1 neuronal responses during deactivation of PAF neurons. These findings support proposed models of hierarchal processing in cat auditory cortex.},

  abstract = {Interactions between living organisms and the environment are commonly regulated by accurate and timely processing of sensory signals. Hence, behavioral response engagement by an organism is typically constrained by the arrival time of sensory information to the brain. While psychophysical response latencies to acoustic information have been investigated, little is known about how variations in neuronal response time relate to sensory signal characteristics. Consequently, the primary objective of the present investigation was to determine the pattern of neuronal activation induced by simple (pure tones), complex (noise bursts and frequency modulated sweeps), and natural (conspecific vocalizations) acoustic signals of different durations in cat auditory cortex. Our analysis revealed three major cortical response characteristics. First, latency measures systematically increase in an antero-dorsal to postero-ventral direction among regions of auditory cortex. Second, complex acoustic stimuli reliably provoke faster neuronal response engagement than simple stimuli. Third, variations in neuronal response time induced by changes in stimulus duration are dependent on acoustic spectral features. Collectively, these results demonstrate that acoustic signals, regardless of complexity, induce a directional pattern of activation in auditory cortex.},

In everyday acoustic environments, the auditory system needs to be capable of performing the discrimination under different acoustic distortions of vocalizations. To achieve this, the auditory system is thought to build a representation of vocalizations that is invariant to their basic acoustic transformations. The mechanism by which neuronal populations create such an invariant representation within the auditory cortex is only beginning to be understood. We recorded the responses of populations of neurons in the primary and nonprimary auditory cortex of rats to original and acoustically distorted vocalizations. We found that populations of neurons in the nonprimary auditory cortex exhibited greater invariance in encoding vocalizations over acoustic transformations than neuronal populations in the primary auditory cortex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that invariant representations are created gradually through hierarchical transformation within the auditory pathway.},

  abstract = {Research software is a critical component of contemporary scholarship. Yet, most research software is developed and managed in ways that are at odds with its long-term sustainability. This paper presents findings from a survey of 1,149 researchers, primarily from the United States, about sustainability challenges they face in developing and using research software. Some of our key findings include a repeated need for more opportunities and time for developers of research software to receive training. These training needs cross the software lifecycle and various types of tools. We also identified the recurring need for better models of funding research software and for providing credit to those who develop the software so they can advance in their careers. The results of this survey will help inform future infrastructure and service support for software developers and users, as well as national research policy aimed at increasing the sustainability of research software.},

  abstract = {Until recently, research in speech perception and speech production has largely focused on the search for psychological and phonetic evidence of discrete, abstract, context-free symbolic units corresponding to phonological segments or phonemes. Despite this common conceptual goal and intimately related objects of study, however, research in these two domains of speech communication has progressed more or less independently for more than 60 years. In this article, we present an overview of the foundational works and current trends in the two fields, specifically discussing the progress made in both lines of inquiry as well as the basic fundamental issues that neither has been able to resolve satisfactorily so far. We then discuss theoretical models and recent experimental evidence that point to the deep, pervasive connections between speech perception and production. We conclude that although research focusing on each domain individually has been vital in increasing our basic understanding of spoken language processing, the human capacity for speech communication is so complex that gaining a full understanding will not be possible until speech perception and production are conceptually reunited in a joint approach to problems shared by both modes.

This classifier can identify speech sounds from a large speech set within 40. ms of stimulus presentation. To compare the temporal limits of the classifier to behavior, we developed a novel task that requires rats to identify individual consonant sounds from a stream of distracter consonants. The classifier successfully predicted the ability of rats to accurately identify speech sounds for syllable presentation rates up to 10 syllables per second (up to 17.9 {$\pm$} 1.5 bits/s), which is comparable to human performance. Our results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal patterns generated in primary auditory cortex can be used to quickly and accurately identify consonant sounds from a continuous speech stream without prior knowledge of the stimulus onset times. Improved understanding of the neural mechanisms that support robust speech processing in difficult listening conditions could improve the identification and treatment of a variety of speech-processing disorders. \textcopyright{} 2013 IBRO.},

After its shutdown in 2016, Freebase is contained in a data dump of 1.9 billion Resource Description Format (RDF) triples. A recomposition of the Freebase ontology will be analyzed in relation to concepts and insights from the literature on classification by Bowker and Star. This paper will explore how the Freebase ontology is shaped by many of the forces that also shape classification systems through a deep dive into the ontology and a small correlational study. These findings will provide a glimpse into the proprietary blackbox Knowledge Graph and what is meant by Google's mission to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful".},

  abstract = {Neurons in sensory brain regions shape our perception of the surrounding environment through two parallel operations: decomposition and integration. For example, auditory neurons decompose sounds by separately encoding their frequency, temporal modulation, intensity, and spatial location. Neurons also integrate across these various features to support a unified perceptual gestalt of an auditory object. At higher levels of a sensory pathway, neurons may select for a restricted region of feature space defined by the intersection of multiple, independent stimulus dimensions. To further characterize how auditory cortical neurons decompose and integrate multiple facets of an isolated sound, we developed an automated procedure that manipulated five fundamental acoustic properties in real time based on single-unit feedback in awake mice. Within several minutes, the online approach converged on regions of the multidimensional stimulus manifold that reliably drove neurons at significantly higher rates than predefined stimuli. Optimized stimuli were cross-validated against pure tone receptive fields and spectrotemporal receptive field estimates in the inferior colliculus and primary auditory cortex. We observed, from midbrain to cortex, increases in both level invariance and frequency selectivity, which may underlie equivalent sparseness of responses in the two areas. We found that onset and steady-state spike rates increased proportionately as the stimulus was tailored to the multidimensional receptive field. By separately evaluating the amount of leverage each sound feature exerted on the overall firing rate, these findings reveal interdependencies between stimulus features as well as hierarchical shifts in selectivity and invariance that may go unnoticed with traditional approaches.},

A powerful example of this phenomenon is categorical speech perception, in which a continuum of acoustically varying sounds is transformed into perceptually distinct phoneme categories. We found that the neural representation of speech sounds is categorically organized in the human posterior superior temporal gyrus. Using intracranial high-density cortical surface arrays, we found that listening to synthesized speech stimuli varying in small and acoustically equal steps evoked distinct and invariant cortical population response patterns that were organized by their sensitivities to critical acoustic features. Phonetic category boundaries were similar between neurometric and psychometric functions. Although speech-sound responses were distributed, spatially discrete cortical loci were found to underlie specific phonetic discrimination. Our results provide direct evidence for acoustic-to-higher order phonetic level encoding of speech sounds in human language receptive cortex.},

We recorded approximately 150 single and multi-units from the left anterior superior temporal gyrus of a patient during multiple auditory experiments. Against low background activity, 45\% of units robustly fired to particular spoken words with little or no response to pure tones, noise-vocoded speech, or environmental sounds. Many units were tuned to complex but specific sets of phonemes, which were influenced by local context but invariant to speaker, and suppressed during self-produced speech. The firing of several units to specific visual letters was correlated with their response to the corresponding auditory phonemes, providing the first direct neural evidence for phonological recoding during reading. Maximal decoding of individual phonemes and words identities was attained using firing rates from approximately 5 neurons within 200 ms after word onset. Thus, neurons in human superior temporal gyrus use sparse spatially organized population encoding of complex acoustic\textendash phonetic features to help recognize auditory and visual words.},

The digital platform can consolidate the consumer data with its existing data set from other services and use it for personalization in related markets. We develop a theoretical model to examine the impact of such mergers across the two markets that are related through a consumption synergy. The merger links the markets for data collection and data application, through which the digital platform can leverage its market power and hurt competitors in both markets. Personalization can lead to exploitation of some consumers in the market for data application. But insofar as competitors remain active, the merger increases total consumer surplus in both markets by intensifying competition. When the consumption synergy is large enough, the merger can result in monopolization of both markets, leading to further consumer harm when stand-alone competitors exit in the long run. Thus, there is a trade-off where potential dynamic costs can outweigh static benefits. We also discuss policy implications by considering various merger remedies.},

Nevertheless, though high SLR can benefit leechers, it will result in "Poor Downloading Motivation" problem to members who want to increase their share ratio in order to safely survive. This problem may discourage PT members' activity. To improve sustainability of PTs, we adopt Predator-Prey model in ecology to analysis high SLR phenomenon, study the optimal stable SLR range to PTs and solve the above problem.

  abstract = {Private P2P communities, as known as "BitTorrent Darknets" or "Private Trackers (PTs)", have received much attention in the research community recently. The downloading performance in PTs with high Seeder-to-Leecher Ratio (SLR) is much better than in public P2P communities because PTs deploy auxiliary Share Ratio Enhancement (SRE) mechanism. Nevertheless, though high SLR can benefit leechers, it will result in "Poor Downloading Motivation" problem to members who want to increase their share ratio in order to safely survive. This problem may discourage PT members' activity. To improve sustainability of PTs, we adopt Predator-Prey model in ecology to analysis high SLR phenomenon, study the optimal stable SLR range to PTs and solve the above problem. Experiments verify our model and provide insight to study PTs.},

  abstract = {In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study.},

In particular, there is increasing collaboration among researchers, which has led to the increasing use of processing techniques and the need to share results and observations. Researchers usually need to compose experiments using available services to fulfill their requirements. However, finding and/or specifying scientific applications is not a trivial task and many scientists lack the computational knowledge necessary to compose their experiments. [Objective] Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop an infrastructure in which researchers can work with heterogeneous information, accessing scientific communities according to their interests. As a result, they can create new experiments with the help of compositions of semantic web services. [Methods] Considering the infrastructure model, a prototype was specified and evaluated in a real-world context. [Results] This evaluation found evidence for the feasibility of the use of this infrastructure in scientific scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed platform where scientists can collaborate in order to specify an experiment and share its results, considering semantic information. This is in agreement with the ideas of ``collaboratories''.},

  abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a U.S. News \& World Report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system.

  abstract = {We introduce the "exponential linear unit" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10\% classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

  abstract = {Rodents engage in social communication through a rich repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). Recording and analysis of USVs has broad utility during diverse behavioral tests and can be performed noninvasively in almost any rodent behavioral model to provide rich insights into the emotional state and motor function of the test animal. Despite strong evidence that USVs serve an array of communicative functions, technical and financial limitations have been barriers for most laboratories to adopt vocalization analysis. Recently, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine hearing and vision, by allowing computers to perform human-like activities including seeing, listening, and speaking. Such systems are constructed from biomimetic, ``deep'', artificial neural networks. Here, we present DeepSqueak, a USV detection and analysis software suite that can perform human quality USV detection and classification automatically, rapidly, and reliably using cutting-edge regional convolutional neural network architecture (Faster-RCNN). DeepSqueak was engineered to allow non-experts easy entry into USV detection and analysis yet is flexible and adaptable with a graphical user interface and offers access to numerous input and analysis features. Compared to other modern programs and manual analysis, DeepSqueak was able to reduce false positives, increase detection recall, dramatically reduce analysis time, optimize automatic syllable classification, and perform automatic syntax analysis on arbitrarily large numbers of syllables, all while maintaining manual selection review and supervised classification. DeepSqueak allows USV recording and analysis to be added easily to existing rodent behavioral procedures, hopefully revealing a wide range of innate responses to provide another dimension of insights into behavior when combined with conventional outcome measures.},

  abstract = {Fostering the free and open sharing of scientific knowledge between the scientific community and general public is the goal of Academic Torrents. At its core it is a distributed network for efficient content dissemination, connecting scientists, academic journals, readers, research groups, and many others. Leveraging the power of its peer-to-peer architecture, Academic Torrents makes science more accessible through two initiatives. The open data initiative allows researchers to share their datasets at high speeds with low bandwidth costs through the peer-to-peer network. The cooperative nature of scientific research demands access to data, but researchers face significant hurdles making their data available. The technical benefits of the Academic Torrents network allows researchers to scalably and globally distribute content, leading to its adoption by labs all around the world to disseminate and share scientific data. Academic Torrent's open access initiative uses the same technology to share open access papers between institutions and individuals. We design a connector to our network that acts as a onsite digital stack to complement the already existing physical stack curated in the same manner. Utilizing the collective resources of the academic community we eliminate the biases in the closed subscription model and the pay to publish model.},

  abstract = {Stimuli are represented in the brain by the collective population responses of sensory neurons, and an object presented under varying conditions gives rise to a collection of neural population responses called an `object manifold'. Changes in the object representation along a hierarchical sensory system are associated with changes in the geometry of those manifolds, and recent theoretical progress connects this geometry with `classification capacity', a quantitative measure of the ability to support object classification. Deep neural networks trained on object classification tasks are a natural testbed for the applicability of this relation. We show how classification capacity improves along the hierarchies of deep neural networks with different architectures. We demonstrate that changes in the geometry of the associated object manifolds underlie this improved capacity, and shed light on the functional roles different levels in the hierarchy play to achieve it, through orchestrated reduction of manifolds' radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that human category learning consists of an early abstraction-based stage followed by a later exemplar-memorization stage. To investigate whether similar processing stages extend to category learning in a nonverbal species, we applied a prototype-exception paradigm to investigating pigeon category learning. Five birds and 8 humans learned six-dimensional perceptual categories constructed to include prototypes, typical items, and exceptions. We evaluated the birds' and humans' categorization strategies at different points during learning. Early on in both species, prototype performance improved rapidly as exception performance remained below chance, indicating an initial mastery of the categories' general structure. Later on, exception performance improved selectively and dramatically, indicating exception-item resolution and exemplar memorization. Abstraction- and exemplar-based formal models reinforced these interpretations. The results suggest a psychological transition in pigeon category learning from abstraction- to exemplar-based processing similar to that found in humans.},

Particular attention is paid to the role structure that operates within the audio piracy subculture, issues of status and power, the division of labor, as well as questions of social conflict and resolution.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Most specialized users (scientists) that use bioinformatics applications do not have suitable training on software development. Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area. OBJECTIVES: This paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains. METHOD: In the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated. RESULTS: Through the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation. This evaluation presents case studies in bioinformatics, which were conducted in two renowned research institutions in Brazil.},

Our discussion focuses on the h-index and the profusion of sources providing it, but we emphasize that many of our points are of a more general nature, and would be equally relevant for other indicators that reach the same level of popularity as the h-index.},

Monkeys heavily favored the family-resemblance strategy.

While the intentions of this trend are not new, the topic gained traction due to technological advancements, most notably blockchain networks. As a consequence, we observe that a new generation of peer-to-peer data networks emerges. In this survey paper, we therefore provide a technical overview of the next generation data networks. We use select data networks to introduce general concepts and to emphasize new developments. Specifically, we provide a deeper outline of the Interplanetary File System and a general overview of Swarm, the Hypercore Protocol, SAFE, Storj, and Arweave. We identify common building blocks and provide a qualitative comparison. From the overview, we derive future challenges and research goals concerning data networks.},

  abstract = {Scientific research requires the collection of data in order to study, monitor, analyze, describe, or understand a particular process or event. Data collection efforts are often a compromise: manual measurements can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, resulting in data being collected at a low frequency, while automating the data-collection process can reduce labor requirements and increase the frequency of measurements, but at the cost of added expense of electronic data-collecting instrumentation. Rapid advances in electronic technologies have resulted in a variety of new and inexpensive sensing, monitoring, and control capabilities which offer opportunities for implementation in agricultural and natural-resource research applications. An Open Source Hardware project called Arduino consists of a programmable microcontroller development platform, expansion capability through add-on boards, and a programming development environment for creating custom microcontroller software. All circuit-board and electronic component specifications, as well as the programming software, are open-source and freely available for anyone to use or modify. Inexpensive sensors and the Arduino development platform were used to develop several inexpensive, automated sensing and datalogging systems for use in agricultural and natural-resources related research projects. Systems were developed and implemented to monitor soil-moisture status of field crops for irrigation scheduling and crop-water use studies, to measure daily evaporation-pan water levels for quantifying evaporative demand, and to monitor environmental parameters under forested conditions. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of automated measurements, and offer guidance for other researchers in developing inexpensive sensing and monitoring systems to further their research.},

  abstract = {This essay examines the economics of patronage in the production of knowledge and its influence upon the historical formation of key elements in the ethos and organizational structure of publicly funded `open science.' The emergence during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of the idea and practice of `open science' was a distinctive and vital organizational aspect of the Scientific Revolution. It represented a break from the previously dominant ethos of secrecy in the pursuit of Nature's Secrets, to a new set of norms, incentives, and organizational structures that reinforced scientific researchers' commitments to rapid disclosure of new knowledge. The rise of `cooperative rivalries' in the revelation of new knowledge, is seen as a functional response to heightened asymmetric information problems posed for the Renaissance system of court-patronage of the arts and sciences; pre-existing informational asymmetries had been exacerbated by the claims of mathematicians and the increasing practical reliance upon new mathematical techniques in a variety of `contexts of application.' Reputational competition among Europe's noble patrons motivated much of their efforts to attract to their courts the most prestigious natural philosophers, was no less crucial in the workings of that system than was the concern among their would-be clients to raise their peer-based reputational status. In late Renaissance Europe, the feudal legacy of fragmented political authority had resulted in relations between noble patrons and their savant-clients that resembled the situation modern economists describe as `common agency contracting in substitutes' -- competition among incompletely informed principals for the dedicated services of multiple agents. These conditions tended to result in contract terms (especially with regard to autonomy and financial support) that left agent client members of the nascent scientific communities better positioned to retain larger information rents on their specialized knowledge. This encouraged entry into their emerging disciplines, and enabled them collectively to develop a stronger degree of professional autonomy for their programs of inquiry within the increasingly specialized and formal scientific academies (such the Acad\'emie royale des Sciences and the Royal Society) that had attracted the patronage of rival absolutist States of Western Europe during the latter part of the seventeenth century. The institutionalization of `open science' that took place within those settings is shown to have continuities with the use by scientists of the earlier humanist academies, and with the logic of regal patronage, rather than being driven by the material requirements of new observational and experimental techniques.},

The timing of these modulations contains critical information for discrimination of important features, such as phonemes. We studied how depression of synaptic inputs, a mechanism frequently reported in cortex, can contribute to the encoding of envelope dynamics. Using a nonlinear stimulus-response model that accounted for synaptic depression, we predicted responses of neurons in ferret primary auditory cortex (A1) to stimuli with natural temporal modulations. The depression model consistently performed better than linear and second-order models previously used to characterize A1 neurons, and it produced more biologically plausible fits. To test how synaptic depression can contribute to temporal stimulus integration, we used nonparametric maximum a posteriori decoding to compare the ability of neurons showing and not showing depression to reconstruct the stimulus envelope. Neurons showing evidence for depression reconstructed stimuli over a longer range of latencies. These findings suggest that variation in depression across the cortical population supports a rich code for representing the temporal dynamics of natural sounds.},

The auditory cortex has evolved to extract behaviorally relevant information from complex natural sounds, but most of our understanding of its function is derived from experiments using simple synthetic stimuli. Previous neurophysiological studies have found that existing models, such as the linear spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF), fail to capture the entire functional relationship between natural stimuli and neural responses. To study this problem, we compared STRFs for A1 neurons estimated using a natural stimulus, continuous speech, with STRFs estimated using synthetic ripple noise. For about one-third of the neurons, we found significant differences between STRFs, usually in the temporal dynamics of inhibition and/or overall gain. This shift in tuning resulted primarily from differences in the coarse temporal structure of the speech and noise stimuli. Using simulations, we found that the stimulus dependence of spectro-temporal tuning can be explained by a model in which synaptic inputs to A1 neurons are susceptible to rapid nonlinear depression. This dynamic reshaping of spectro-temporal tuning suggests that synaptic depression may enable efficient encoding of natural auditory stimuli.},

  abstract = {As sensory stimuli and behavioral demands change, the attentive brain quickly identifies task-relevant stimuli and associates them with appropriate motor responses. The effects of attention on sensory processing vary across task paradigms, suggesting that the brain may use multiple strategies and mechanisms to highlight attended stimuli and link them to motor action. To better understand factors that contribute to these variable effects, we studied sensory representations in primary auditory cortex (A1) during two instrumental tasks that shared the same auditory discrimination but required different behavioral responses, either approach or avoidance. In the approach task, ferrets were rewarded for licking a spout when they heard a target tone amid a sequence of reference noise sounds. In the avoidance task, they were punished unless they inhibited licking to the target. To explore how these changes in task reward structure influenced attention-driven rapid plasticity in A1, we measured changes in sensory neural responses during behavior. Responses to the target changed selectively during both tasks but did so with opposite sign. Despite the differences in sign, both effects were consistent with a general neural coding strategy that maximizes discriminability between sound classes. The dependence of the direction of plasticity on task suggests that representations in A1 change not only to sharpen representations of task-relevant stimuli but also to amplify responses to stimuli that signal aversive outcomes and lead to behavioral inhibition. Thus, top-down control of sensory processing can be shaped by task reward structure in addition to the required sensory discrimination.},

We will review four processes that contribute to the perception of speech: perceptual grouping, lexical segmentation, perceptual learning and categorical perception, in each case presenting perceptual evidence to support highly interactive processes with top-down information flow driving and constraining interpretations of spoken input. The cognitive and neural underpinnings of these interactive processes appear to depend on two distinct representations of heard speech: an auditory, echoic representation of incoming speech, and a motoric/somatotopic representation of speech as it would be produced. We review the neuroanatomical system supporting these two key properties of speech perception and discuss how this system incorporates interactive processes and two parallel echoic and somato-motoric representations, drawing on evidence from functional neuroimaging studies in humans and from comparative anatomical studies. We propose that top-down interactive mechanisms within auditory networks play an important role in explaining the perception of spoken language. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Learning was enhanced if listeners heard distorted sentences while they knew the identity of the undistorted target (Experiments 2 and 3). Learning was absent when listeners were trained with nonword sentences (Experiments 4 and 5), although the meaning of the training sentences did not affect learning (Experiment 5).

  abstract = {Auditory neurons must represent accurately a wide range of sound levels using firing rates that vary over a far narrower range of levels. Recently, we demonstrated that this ``dynamic range problem'' is lessened by neural adaptation, whereby neurons adjust their input\textendash output functions for sound level according to the prevailing distribution of levels. These adjustments in input\textendash output functions increase the accuracy with which levels around those occurring most commonly are coded by the neural population. Here, we examine how quickly this adaptation occurs. We recorded from single neurons in the auditory midbrain during a stimulus that switched repeatedly between two distributions of sound levels differing in mean level. The high-resolution analysis afforded by this stimulus showed that a prominent component of the adaptation occurs rapidly, with an average time constant across neurons of 160 ms after an increase in mean level, much faster than our previous experiments were able to assess. This time course appears to be independent of both the timescale over which sound levels varied and that over which sound level distributions varied, but is related to neural characteristic frequency. We find that adaptation to an increase in mean level occurs more rapidly than to a decrease. Finally, we observe an additional, slow adaptation in some neurons, which occurs over a timescale of tens of seconds. Our findings provide constraints in the search for mechanisms underlying adaptation to sound level. They also have functional implications for the role of adaptation in the representation of natural sounds.},

How does the cortex decompose perceived sounds? A reverse correlation technique demonstrates that neurons in the primary auditory cortex of the awake primate have complex patterns of sound-feature selectivity that indicate sensitivity to stimulus edges in frequency or in time, stimulus transitions in frequency or intensity, and feature conjunctions. This allows the creation of classes of stimuli matched to the processing characteristics of auditory cortical neurons. Stimuli designed for a particular neuron's preferred feature pattern can drive that neuron with higher sustained firing rates than have typically been recorded with simple stimuli. These data suggest that the cortex decomposes an auditory scene into component parts using a feature-processing system reminiscent of that used for the cortical decomposition of visual images.},

  abstract = {DIYbio challenges the status quo by positioning laboratory biology work outside of traditional institutions. HCI has increasingly explored the DIYbio movement, but we lack insight into sites of practice such as community biolabs. Therefore, we gathered data on eleven community biolabs by interviewing sixteen lab managers and members. These labs represent half of identified organizations in scope worldwide. Participants detailed their practices and motivations, outlining the constraints and opportunities of their community biolabs. We found that lab members conducted technically challenging project work with access to high-end equipment and professional expertise. We found that the unique nature of biowork exacerbated challenges for cooperative work, partially due to the particular time sensitivities of work with living organisms. Building on our findings, we discuss how community biolab members are creating new approaches to laboratory biology and how this has design implications for systems that support non-traditional settings for scientific practice.},

  abstract = {Current attempts at methodological reform in sciences come in response to an overall lack of rigor in methodological and scientific practices in experimental sciences. However, most methodological reform attempts suffer from similar mistakes and over-generalizations to the ones they aim to address. We argue that this can be attributed in part to lack of formalism and first principles. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for formal statistical rigor and scientific nuance in methodological reform. To attain this rigor and nuance, we propose a five-step formal approach for solving methodological problems. To illustrate the use and benefits of such formalism, we present a formal statistical analysis of three popular claims in the metascientific literature: (i) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (ii) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (iii) that exploratory projects imply poor statistical practice. We show how our formal approach can inform and shape debates about such methodological claims.},

Primary safety issues are the inability to enforce reliable specification of component dependencies, and the lack of support for multiple versions or variants of a component. This renders deployment operations such as upgrading or deleting components dangerous and unpredictable. A deployment system must also be flexible (i.e., policy-free) enough to support both centralised and local package management, and to allow a variety of mechanisms for transferring components. In this paper we present Nix, a deployment system that addresses these issues through a simple technique of using cryptographic hashes to compute unique paths for component instances.}

The stimuli used in these experiments were identical to those used in a previous study of speech perception by humans [Best et al., Percept. Psychophys. 45, 237\textendash 250 (1989)]. Budgerigars and zebra finches were trained using operant conditioning and tested on three different series of acoustic stimuli: three-formant synthetic speech, sinewave versions of those tokens, and isolated F3 tones from the sinewave speech. Both species showed enhanced discrimination performance near the /l/\textendash/r/ boundary in the full-formant speech continuum, whereas for the F3 continuum, neither species showed a peak near this boundary. These results are similar to human discrimination of the same continua. Budgerigars also showed a peak in discrimination of the sinewave analog continuum paralleling that for full-formant syllables, similar to humans who are induced to perceive sinewave speech as speech. Zebra finches, by contrast, showed a relatively flat function mirroring their performance for F3 sinewaves, similar to humans who are induced to perceive sinewave speech as nonspeech. These data provide new evidence of species similarities and differences in the discrimination of speech and speechlike sounds. These data also strengthen and refine previous findings on the sensitivities of the vertebrate auditory system to the acoustic distinctions between speechsound categories.},

One approach involves extracting contrastive features from fully-specified minimal pairs. I will show that this approach is provably untenable. A second approach arrives at contrastive specifications by ordering features into a hierarchy, and splitting up the inventory by successive divisions until all phonemes have been distinguished. I will show that this hierarchical approach solves the problems encountered by the minimal-pairs method. Moreover, a hierarchical approach to contrastiveness is implicit in much descriptive phonological practice, and can be found even in the work of theorists who argue against it. Given the centrality of the issue, it is remarkable that it has received almost no attention in the literature. Recovering this missing chapter of phonological theory sheds new light on a number of controversies over contrast in phonology.},

Whether and how these two aspects interact to shape computations is currently unclear. Using a novel approach to extract computational mechanisms from networks trained with machine-learning tools on neuroscience tasks, here we show that the dimensionality of the dynamics and cell-class structure play fundamentally complementary roles. While various tasks can be implemented by increasing the dimensionality in networks consisting of a single global population, flexible input-output mappings instead required networks to be organized into several sub-populations. Our analyses revealed that the subpopulation structure enabled flexible computations through a mechanism based on gain-controlled modulations that flexibly shape the dynamical landscape of collective dynamics. Our results lead to task-specific predictions for the structure of neural selectivity and inactivation experiments.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Rules are often deduced through evidence-based learning which relies on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is a highly dynamic process, evolving trial by trial and therefore may not be adequately captured by averaging single-unit responses over numerous repetitions. Here, we employed advanced statistical techniques to visualize the trajectories of ensembles of simultaneously recorded medial PFC neurons on a trial-by-trial basis as rats deduced a novel rule in a set-shifting task. Neural populations formed clearly distinct and lasting representations of familiar and novel rules by entering unique network states. During rule acquisition, the recorded ensembles often exhibited abrupt transitions, rather than evolving continuously, in tight temporal relation to behavioral performance shifts. These results support the idea that rule learning is an evidence-based decision process, perhaps accompanied by moments of sudden insight.},

In simple perceptual generalization tasks, the human visual system performs as if it represents the stimuli in a low-dimensional metric psychological space (Shepard 1987). In theories of three-dimensional (3D) shape recognition, the role of feature-space representations [as opposed to structural (Biederman 1987) or pictorial (Ullman 1989) descriptions] has long been a major point of contention. If shapes are indeed represented as points in a feature space, patterns of perceived similarity among different objects must reflect the structure of this space. The feature space hypothesis can then be tested by presenting subjects with complex parameterized 3D shapes, and by relating the similarities among subjective representations, as revealed in the response data by multidimensional scaling (Shepard 1980), to the objective parameterization of the stimuli. The results of four such tests, accompanied by computational simulations, support the notion that discrimination among 3D objects may rely on a low-dimensional feature space representation, and suggest that this space may be spanned by explicitly encoded class prototypes.},

I propose a unified approach to visual representation, addressing the need for superordinate and basic-level categorization and for the identification of specific instances of familiar categories. According to the proposed theory, a shape is represented internally by the responses of a small number of tuned modules, each broadly selective for some reference shape, whose similarity to the stimulus it measures. This amounts to embedding the stimulus in a low-dimensional proximal shape space spanned by the outputs of the active modules. This shape space supports representations of distal shape similarities that are veridical as Shepard's (1968) second-order isomorphisms (i.e., correspondence between distal and proximal similarities among shapes, rather than between distal shapes and their proximal representations). Representation in terms of similarities to reference shapes supports processing (e.g., discrimination) of shapes that are radically different from the reference ones, without the need for the computationally problematic decomposition into parts required by other theories. Furthermore, a general expression for similarity between two stimuli, based on comparisons to reference shapes, can be used to derive models of perceived similarity ranging from continuous, symmetric, and hierarchical ones, as in multidimensional scaling (Shepard 1980), to discrete and nonhierarchical ones, as in the general contrast models (Shepard \& Arabie 1979; Tversky 1977).},

These detectors are each sensitive to a restricted range of voice onset times, the physical continuum underlying the perceived phonetic distinctions between voiced and voiceless stop consonants. The sensitivity of a particular detector can be reduced selectively by repetitive presentation of its adequate stimulus. This results in a shift in the locus of the phonetic boundary separating the voiced and voiceless stops.},

In this work, we use real resting-state data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the fMRI software packages SPM, FSL, and AFNI, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {We systematically determined which spectrotemporal modulations in speech are necessary for comprehension by human listeners. Speech comprehension has been shown to be robust to spectral and temporal degradations, but the specific relevance of particular degradations is arguable due to the complexity of the joint spectral and temporal information in the speech signal. We applied a novel modulation filtering technique to recorded sentences to restrict acoustic information quantitatively and to obtain a joint spectrotemporal modulation transfer function for speech comprehension, the speech MTF. For American English, the speech MTF showed the criticality of low modulation frequencies in both time and frequency. Comprehension was significantly impaired when temporal modulations {$<$}12 Hz or spectral modulations {$<$}4 cycles/kHz were removed. More specifically, the MTF was bandpass in temporal modulations and low-pass in spectral modulations: temporal modulations from 1 to 7 Hz and spectral modulations {$<$}1 cycles/kHz were the most important. We evaluated the importance of spectrotemporal modulations for vocal gender identification and found a different region of interest: removing spectral modulations between 3 and 7 cycles/kHz significantly increases gender misidentifications of female speakers. The determination of the speech MTF furnishes an additional method for producing speech signals with reduced bandwidth but high intelligibility. Such compression could be used for audio applications such as file compression or noise removal and for clinical applications such as signal processing for cochlear implants.},

This procedure takes a set of input/output pattern pairs and attempts to learn their functional relationship; it develops the necessary representational features during the course of learning. A series of computer simulation studies was carried out to assess the ability of these networks to accurately label sounds, to learn to recognize sounds without labels, and to learn feature representations of continuous speech. These studies demonstrated that the networks can learn to label presegmented test tokens with accuracies of up to 95\%. Networks trained on segmented sounds using a strategy that requires no external labels were able to recognize and delineate sounds in continuous speech. These networks developed rich internal representations that included units which corresponded to such traditional distinctions as vowels and consonants, as well as units that were sensitive to novel and nonstandard features. Networks trained on a large corpus of unsegmented, continuous speech without labels also developed interesting feature representations, which may be useful in both segmentation and label learning. The results of these studies, while preliminary, demonstrate that backpropagation learning can be used with complex, natural data to identify a feature structure that can serve as the basis for both analysis and nontrivial pattern recognition.},

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons use temporal precision on the order of 1-10 ms to represent speech sounds shifted into the rat hearing range. Neural discrimination was highly correlated with behavioral performance on 11 consonant-discrimination tasks when spike timing was preserved and was not correlated when spike timing was eliminated. This result suggests that spike timing contributes to the auditory cortex representation of consonant sounds.},

While the neighboring auditory cortical fields each contain information about speech sound identity, each field processes speech sounds differently. We hypothesized that while all fields would exhibit training-induced plasticity following speech training, there would be unique differences in how each field changes. In this study, rats were trained to discriminate speech sounds by consonant or vowel in quiet and in varying levels of background speech-shaped noise. Local field potential and multiunit responses were recorded from four auditory cortex fields in rats that had received 10 weeks of speech discrimination training. Our results reveal that training alters speech evoked responses in each of the auditory fields tested. The neural response to consonants was significantly stronger in anterior auditory field (AAF) and A1 following speech training. The neural response to vowels following speech training was significantly weaker in ventral auditory field (VAF) and posterior auditory field (PAF). This differential plasticity of consonant and vowel sound responses may result from the greater paired pulse depression, expanded low frequency tuning, reduced frequency selectivity, and lower tone thresholds, which occurred across the four auditory fields. These findings suggest that alterations in the distributed processing of behaviorally relevant sounds may contribute to robust speech discrimination.},

  abstract = {Over the last 50 yr, environmental enrichment has been shown to generate more than a dozen changes in brain anatomy. The consequences of these physical changes on information processing have not been well studied. In this study, rats were housed in enriched or standard conditions either prior to or after reaching sexual maturity. Evoked potentials from awake rats and extracellular recordings from anesthetized rats were used to document responses of auditory cortex neurons. This report details several significant, new findings about the influence of housing conditions on the responses of rat auditory cortex neurons. First, enrichment dramatically increases the strength of auditory cortex responses. Tone-evoked potentials of enriched rats, for example, were more than twice the amplitude of rats raised in standard laboratory conditions. Second, cortical responses of both young and adult animals benefit from exposure to an enriched environment and are degraded by exposure to an impoverished environment. Third, housing condition resulted in rapid remodeling of cortical responses in 2 wk. Fourth, recordings made under anesthesia indicate that enrichment increases the number of neurons activated by any sound. This finding shows that the evoked potential plasticity documented in awake rats was not due to differences in behavioral state. Finally, enrichment made primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons more sensitive to quiet sounds, more selective for tone frequency, and altered their response latencies. These experiments provide the first evidence of physiologic changes in auditory cortex processing resulting from generalized environmental enrichment.},

  abstract = {Previous studies in both humans and animals have documented improved performance following discrimination training. This enhanced performance is often associated with cortical response changes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that long-term speech training on multiple tasks can improve primary auditory cortex (A1) responses compared to rats trained on a single speech discrimination task or experimentally na\"ive rats. Specifically, we compared the percent of A1 responding to trained sounds, the responses to both trained and untrained sounds, receptive field properties of A1 neurons, and the neural discrimination of pairs of speech sounds in speech trained and na\"ive rats. Speech training led to accurate discrimination of consonant and vowel sounds, but did not enhance A1 response strength or the neural discrimination of these sounds. Speech training altered tone responses in rats trained on six speech discrimination tasks but not in rats trained on a single speech discrimination task. Extensive speech training resulted in broader frequency tuning, shorter onset latencies, a decreased driven response to tones, and caused a shift in the frequency map to favor tones in the range where speech sounds are the loudest. Both the number of trained tasks and the number of days of training strongly predict the percent of A1 responding to a low frequency tone. Rats trained on a single speech discrimination task performed less accurately than rats trained on multiple tasks and did not exhibit A1 response changes. Our results indicate that extensive speech training can reorganize the A1 frequency map, which may have downstream consequences on speech sound processing.},

While the neighboring auditory cortical fields each contain information about speech sound identity, each field processes speech sounds differently. We hypothesized that while all fields would exhibit training-induced plasticity following speech training, there would be unique differences in how each field changes. In this study, rats were trained to discriminate speech sounds by consonant or vowel in quiet and in varying levels of background speech-shaped noise. Local field potential and multiunit responses were recorded from four auditory cortex fields in rats that had received 10 weeks of speech discrimination training.

  abstract = {To learn from their environments, infants must detect structure behind pervasive variation. This presents substantial and largely untested learning challenges in early language acquisition. The current experiments address whether infants can use statistical learning mechanisms to segment words when the speech signal contains acoustic variation produced by changes in speakers' voices. In Experiment 1, 8- and 10-month-old infants listened to a continuous stream of novel words produced by 8 different female voices. The voices alternated frequently, potentially interrupting infants' detection of transitional probability patterns that mark word boundaries. Infants at both ages successfully segmented words in the speech stream. In Experiment 2, 8-month-olds demonstrated the ability to generalize their learning about the speech stream when presented with a new, acoustically distinct voice during testing. However, in Experiments 3 and 4, when the same speech stream was produced by only 2 female voices, infants failed to segment the words. The results of these experiments indicate that low acoustic variation may interfere with infants' efficiency in segmenting words from continuous speech, but that infants successfully use statistical cues to segment words in conditions of high acoustic variation. These findings contribute to our understanding of whether statistical learning mechanisms can scale up to meet the demands of natural learning environments.},

  abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of ``universal,'' we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition.Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.},

These public manifestations of piracy, though, conceal an elite worldwide, underground, organized network of pirate groups who specialize in obtaining media \textendash{} music, videos, games, and software \textendash{} before their official sale date and then racing against one another to release the material for free.  Warez: The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy is the first scholarly research book about this underground subculture, which began life in the pre-internet era Bulletin Board Systems and moved to internet File Transfer Protocol servers (``topsites'') in the mid- to late-1990s. The ``Scene,'' as it is known, is highly illegal in almost every aspect of its operations. The term ``Warez'' itself refers to pirated media, a derivative of ``software.'' Taking a deep dive in the documentary evidence produced by the Scene itself, Warez describes the operations and infrastructures an underground culture with its own norms and rules of participation, its own forms of sociality, and its own artistic forms. Even though forms of digital piracy are often framed within ideological terms of equal access to knowledge and culture, Eve uncovers in the Warez Scene a culture of competitive ranking and one-upmanship that is at odds with the often communalist interpretations of piracy.  Broad in scope and novel in its approach, Warez is indispensible reading for anyone interested in recent developments in digital culture, access to knowledge and culture, and the infrastructures that support our digital age.},

However, in designing such P2P file sharing protocols, there is a fundamental "tussle" between keeping peers, specially the more resourceful ones, in the system for as long as possible to help the system achieve better performance and allowing peers finish their download as quickly as possible. The current BT protocol represents only "one" possible implementation in this whole design spectrum. In this paper, we characterize the "complete" design space of BT-like protocols. We use fairness index to measure the fairness that incorporates the contribution peers make. We show that there is a wide range of design choices, ranging from optimizing the performance of file download, to optimizing the fairness measure. More importantly, we show that there is a simple and easily implementable design knob which can be used to choose a particular operating point in the design space. We then discuss different algorithms (centralized versus distributed) in realizing the design knob. We also carry out performance evaluation to quantify the merits and properties of the BT-like file sharing protocols.},

Against this backdrop, policy makers are increasingly advocating for making research data and supporting material openly available online. Despite its potential to further scientific progress, widespread data sharing in small science is still an ideal practised in moderation. In this article, we explore the question of what drives open access to research data using a survey among 1564 mainly German researchers across all disciplines. We show that, regardless of their disciplinary background, researchers recognize the benefits of open access to research data for both their own research and scientific progress as a whole. Nonetheless, most researchers share their data only selectively. We show that individual reward considerations conflict with widespread data sharing. Based on our results, we present policy implications that are in line with both individual reward considerations and scientific progress.},

  abstract = {Academic data sharing is a way for researchers to collaborate and thereby meet the needs of an increasingly complex research landscape. It enables researchers to verify results and to pursuit new research questions with "old" data. It is therefore not surprising that data sharing is advocated by funding agencies, journals, and researchers alike. We surveyed 2661 individual academic researchers across all disciplines on their dealings with data, their publication practices, and motives for sharing or withholding research data. The results for 1564 valid responses show that researchers across disciplines recognise the benefit of secondary research data for their own work and for scientific progress as a whole-still they only practice it in moderation. An explanation for this evidence could be an academic system that is not driven by monetary incentives, nor the desire for scientific progress, but by individual reputation-expressed in (high ranked journal) publications. We label this system a Reputation Economy. This special economy explains our findings that show that researchers have a nuanced idea how to provide adequate formal recognition for making data available to others-namely data citations. We conclude that data sharing will only be widely adopted among research professionals if sharing pays in form of reputation. Thus, policy measures that intend to foster research collaboration need to understand academia as a reputation economy. Successful measures must value intermediate products, such as research data, more highly than it is the case now.},

  abstract = {Clinical, biomedical, and translational science has reached an inflection point in the breadth and diversity of available data and the potential impact of such data to improve human health and well-being. However, the data are often siloed, disorganized, and not broadly accessible due to discipline-specific differences in terminology and representation. To address these challenges, the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium has developed and tested a pilot knowledge graph-based ``Translator'' system capable of integrating existing biomedical data sets and ``translating'' those data into insights intended to augment human reasoning and accelerate translational science. Having demonstrated feasibility of the Translator system, the Translator program has since moved into development, and the Translator Consortium has made significant progress in the research, design, and implementation of an operational system. Herein, we describe the current system's architecture, performance, and quality of results. We apply Translator to several real-world use cases developed in collaboration with subject-matter experts. Finally, we discuss the scientific and technical features of Translator and compare those features to other state-of-the-art, biomedical graph-based question-answering systems.},

Generalization can even proceed from a single object (``one-shot categorization''). The inference is apparently guided by the principle that a good categorical hypothesis is one in which the observed object would be a typcal, ``non-accidental,'' orgenericexample; this idea is formalized here as the Genericity Constraint. In the theory proposed here, each categorical hypothesis is a ``generative model,'' a sequence of transformations by which the object is interpreted as having been created; objects are considered to be in the same category if they were created by the same set of operations. The set of all available category models can be explicitly enumerated in a lattice, an explicit structure that partially orders the models by their degree of regularity or genericity\textemdash more abstract models are higher in the lattice, and more regular or constrained models are lower. The Genericity Constraint dictates that among all the models on the lattice that apply, the observer should choose the one in which the observed object is generic, which is simply the lowest in the partial order. A series of experiments are reported in which subjects are asked to generalize from simple figures. The results corroborate the role of the lattice and the Genericity Constraint in subjects' interpretations},

Native speakers of English learned to categorize Mandarin lexical tone categories produced by multiple talkers using trial-by-trial feedback. We hypothesized that the corticostriatal system is a key intermediary in mediating temporal lobe plasticity and the acquisition of new speech categories in adulthood. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which participants underwent a sound-to-category mapping task. Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected, and probabilistic fiber tracking analysis was employed to assay the auditory corticostriatal pathways. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that talker-invariant novel tone category representations emerged in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) within a few hundred training trials. Univariate analysis showed that the putamen, a subregion of the striatum, was sensitive to positive feedback in correctly categorized trials. With learning, functional coupling between the putamen and LSTG increased during error processing. Furthermore, fiber tractography demonstrated robust structural connectivity between the feedback-sensitive striatal regions and the LSTG regions that represent the newly learned tone categories. Our convergent findings highlight a critical role for the auditory corticostriatal circuitry in mediating the acquisition of new speech categories.},

While neural representations of speech categories have been previously identified in frontal and posterior temporal-parietal regions, the task dependency and dimensional specificity of these neural representations are still unclear. Here, we asked native Mandarin participants to listen to speech syllables carrying 4 distinct lexical tone categories across passive listening, repetition, and categorization tasks while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used searchlight classification and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to identify the dimensional structure underlying neural representation across tasks and surface-acoustic properties. Searchlight classification analyses revealed significant "cross-task" lexical tone decoding within the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL). RSA revealed that the LIPL and LSTG, in contrast to the RSTG, relate to 2 critical dimensions (pitch height, pitch direction) underlying tone perception. Outside this core representational network, we found greater activation in the inferior frontal and parietal regions for stimuli that are more perceptually similar during tone categorization. Our findings reveal the specific characteristics of fronto-tempo-parietal regions that support speech representation and categorization processing.},

Although the lectures are over ten years old, most of the material is timeless and presents a "Feynmanesque" overview of many standard and some not-so-standard topics in computer science. These include compatibility, Turing machines (or as Feynman said, "Mr. Turing's machines"), information theory, Shannon's Theorem, reversible computation, the thermodynamics of computation, the quantum limits to computation, and the physics of VLSI devices. Taken together, these lectures represent a unique exploration of the fundamental limitations of digital computers. Feynman's philosophy of learning and discovery comes through strongly in these lectures. He constantly points out the benefits of playing around with concepts and working out solutions to problems on your own - before looking at the back of the book for the answers. As Feynman says in the lectures: "If you keep proving stuff that others have done, getting confidence, increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you'll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one! And that's the way to become a computer scientist."},

Data collection efforts are often a compromise: manual measurements can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, resulting in data being collected at a low frequency, while automating the data-collection process can reduce labor requirements and increase the frequency of measurements, but at the cost of added expense of electronic data-collecting instrumentation. Rapid advances in electronic technologies have resulted in a variety of new and inexpensive sensing, monitoring, and control capabilities which offer opportunities for implementation in agricultural and natural-resource research applications. An Open Source Hardware project called Arduino consists of a programmable microcontroller development platform, expansion capability through add-on boards, and a programming development environment for creating custom microcontroller software. All circuit-board and electronic component specifications, as well as the programming software, are open-source and freely available for anyone to use or modify. Inexpensive sensors and the Arduino development platform were used to develop several inexpensive, automated sensing and datalogging systems for use in agricultural and natural-resources related research projects. Systems were developed and implemented to monitor soil-moisture status of field crops for irrigation scheduling and crop-water use studies, to measure daily evaporation-pan water levels for quantifying evaporative demand, and to monitor environmental parameters under forested conditions. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of automated measurements, and offer guidance for other researchers in developing inexpensive sensing and monitoring systems to further their research.},

At least two changes were necessary prerequisites for modern human speech abilities: (1) modification of vocal tract morphology, and (2) development of vocal imitative ability. Despite an extensive literature, attempts to pinpoint the timing of these changes using fossil data have proven inconclusive. However, recent comparative data from nonhuman primates have shed light on the ancestral use of formants (a crucial cue in human speech) to identify individuals and gauge body size. Second, comparative analysis of the diverse vertebrates that have evolved vocal imitation (humans, cetaceans, seals and birds) provides several distinct, testable hypotheses about the adaptive function of vocal mimicry. These developments suggest that, for understanding the evolution of speech, comparative analysis of living species provides a viable alternative to fossil data. However, the neural basis for vocal mimicry and for mimesis in general remains unknown.},

Eclipsed by his later work on power and discourse, nonetheless it was The Order of Things that established Foucault's reputation as an intellectual giant. Pirouetting around the outer edge of language, Foucault unsettles the surface of literary writing. In describing the limitations of our usual taxonomies, he opens the door onto a whole new system of thought, one ripe with what he calls "exotic charm".

Some have suggested that the time course of context effects is incompatible with interactive models (e.g., TRACE). Two experiments examine this issue. In Experiment 1, subjects heard noun- and verb-biasing sentence contexts (e.g., Valerie hated the . . . vs. Brett hated to . . .), followed by stimuli from 2 voice-onset time continua: bay-pay (noun-verb) versus buy-pie (verb-noun). Consistent with prior research, identification of phonetically ambiguous targets was biased by the preceding context, and the size of this bias diminished in slower compared with faster responses. In Experiment 2, tokens from the same continua were embedded among filler target words beginning with /b/ or /p/ to elicit phonemically driven identification decisions and discourage word-level strategies. Results again revealed contextually biased responding, but this bias was as strong in slow as in fast responses. Together, these results suggest that phoneme identification decisions reflect robust, lasting top-down effects of lexical feedback on prelexical representations, as predicted by interactive models of speech perception.},

  abstract = {Listening is an active process in which attentive focus on salient acoustic features in auditory tasks can influence receptive field properties of cortical neurons. Recent studies showing rapid task-related changes in neuronal spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in primary auditory cortex of the behaving ferret are reviewed in the context of current research on cortical plasticity. Ferrets were trained on spectral tasks, including tone detection and two-tone discrimination, and on temporal tasks, including gap detection and click-rate discrimination. STRF changes could be measured on-line during task performance and occurred within minutes of task onset. During spectral tasks, there were specific spectral changes (enhanced response to tonal target frequency in tone detection and discrimination, suppressed response to tonal reference frequency in tone discrimination). However, only in the temporal tasks, the STRF was changed along the temporal dimension by sharpening temporal dynamics. In ferrets trained on multiple tasks, distinctive and task-specific STRF changes could be observed in the same cortical neurons in successive behavioral sessions. These results suggest that rapid task-related plasticity is an ongoing process that occurs at a network and single unit level as the animal switches between different tasks and dynamically adapts cortical STRFs in response to changing acoustic demands. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies showing rapid task-related changes in neuronal spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in primary auditory cortex of the behaving ferret are reviewed in the context of current research on cortical plasticity. Ferrets were trained on spectral tasks, including tone detection and two-tone discrimination, and on temporal tasks, including gap detection and click-rate discrimination. STRF changes could be measured on-line during task performance and occurred within minutes of task onset. During spectral tasks, there were specific spectral changes (enhanced response to tonal target frequency in tone detection and discrimination, suppressed response to tonal reference frequency in tone discrimination). However, only in the temporal tasks, the STRF was changed along the temporal dimension by sharpening temporal dynamics. In ferrets trained on multiple tasks, distinctive and task-specific STRF changes could be observed in the same cortical neurons in successive behavioral sessions. These results suggest that rapid task-related plasticity is an ongoing process that occurs at a network and single unit level as the animal switches between different tasks and dynamically adapts cortical STRFs in response to changing acoustic demands.},

  abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that task performance can rapidly and adaptively reshape cortical receptive field properties in accord with specific task demands and salient sensory cues. We recorded neuronal responses in the primary auditory cortex of behaving ferrets that were trained to detect a target tone of any frequency. Cortical plasticity was quantified by measuring focal changes in each cell's spectrotemporal response field (STRF) in a series of passive and active behavioral conditions. STRF measurements were made simultaneously with task performance, providing multiple snapshots of the dynamic STRF during ongoing behavior. Attending to a specific target frequency during the detection task consistently induced localized facilitative changes in STRF shape, which were swift in onset. Such modulatory changes may enhance overall cortical responsiveness to the target tone and increase the likelihood of 'capturing' the attended target during the detection task. Some receptive field changes persisted for hours after the task was over and hence may contribute to long-term sensory memory.},

  abstract = {Receptive fields of sensory cortical neurons are plastic, changing in response to alterations of neural activity or sensory experience. In this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of particular stimuli. Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits. Here we determine the dynamics of synaptic receptive field plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex (also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace for stimuli or episodes that have acquired new behavioural significance.},

Many studies demonstrate that adult humans show CP for human emotional faces. It is widely debated whether the effect can be accounted for solely by perceptual differences (structural differences among emotional faces) or whether additional perceiver-based conceptual knowledge is required. In this review, I discuss the phenomenon of CP and key studies showing CP for emotional faces. I then discuss a new model of emotion which highlights how perceptual and conceptual knowledge interact to explain how people see discrete emotions in others' faces. In doing so, I discuss how language (emotion words included in the paradigm) contribute to CP.},

  abstract = {Humans can recognize spoken words with unmatched speed and accuracy. Hearing the initial portion of a word such as ``formu\ldots '' is sufficient for the brain to identify ``formula'' from the thousands of other words that partially match [1\textendash 6]. Two alternative computational accounts propose that partially matching words (1) inhibit each other until a single word is selected (``formula'' inhibits ``formal'' by lexical competition [7\textendash 9]) or (2) are used to predict upcoming speech sounds more accurately (segment prediction error is minimal after sequences like ``formu\ldots '' [10\textendash 12]). To distinguish these theories we taught participants novel words (e.g., ``formubo'') that sound like existing words (``formula'') on two successive days [13\textendash 16]. Computational simulations show that knowing ``formubo'' increases lexical competition when hearing ``formu\ldots '', but reduces segment prediction error. Conversely, when the sounds in ``formula'' and ``formubo'' diverge, the reverse is observed. The time course of magnetoencephalographic brain responses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) is uniquely consistent with a segment prediction account. We propose a predictive coding model of spoken word recognition in which STG neurons represent the difference between predicted and heard speech sounds. This prediction error signal explains the efficiency of human word recognition and simulates neural responses in auditory regions.},

We investigate the flexibility of M1 movement control by analyzing neural population activity during a variety of skilled wrist and reach-to-grasp tasks. We compare across tasks the neural modes that capture dominant neural covariance patterns during each task. While each task requires different patterns of muscle and single unit activity, we find unexpected similarities at the neural population level: the structure and activity of the neural modes is largely preserved across tasks. Furthermore, we find two sets of neural modes with task-independent activity that capture, respectively, generic temporal features of the set of tasks and a task-independent mapping onto muscle activity. This system of flexibly combined, well-preserved neural modes may underlie the ability of M1 to learn and generate a wide-ranging behavioral repertoire.},

Scientific applications require specific versions of compilers, MPI, and other dependency libraries, so using a single, standard software stack is infeasible. However, managing many configurations is difficult because the configuration space is combinatorial in size.We introduce Spack, a tool used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to manage this complexity. Spack provides a novel, recursive specification syntax to invoke parametric builds of packages and dependencies. It allows any number of builds to coexist on the same system, and it ensures that installed packages can find their dependencies, regardless of the environment. We show through real-world use cases that Spack supports diverse and demanding applications, bringing order to HPC software chaos.},

While the economic perspective informs our understanding of platform competition, the engineering design perspective informs our view of platform innovation. The article argues that platforms can be usefully conceptualized as evolving organizations or meta-organizations that: (1) federate and coordinate constitutive agents who can innovate and compete; (2) create value by generating and harnessing economies of scope in supply or/and in demand; and (3) entail a modular technological architecture composed of a core and a periphery. In support of this conceptualization, a classification system is presented, indicating that technological platforms appear in a variety of organizational forms: within firms, across supply chains, and across industry innovation ecosystems. As an illustration, the framework is then applied to derive a simple model highlighting patterns of interaction between platform innovation and competition, yielding hypotheses that could be tested empirically by future scholars.},

  abstract = {Many natural signals, including environmental sounds, exhibit scale-invariant statistics: their structure is repeated at multiple scales. Such scale-invariance has been identified separately across spectral and temporal correlations of natural sounds (Clarke and Voss, 1975; Attias and Schreiner, 1997; Escabi et al., 2003; Singh and Theunissen, 2003). Yet the role of scale-invariance across overall spectro-temporal structure of the sound has not been explored directly in auditory perception. Here, we identify that the acoustic waveform from the recording of running water is a self-similar fractal, exhibiting scale-invariance not only within spectral channels, but also across the full spectral bandwidth. The auditory perception of the water sound did not change with its scale. We tested the role of scale-invariance in perception by using an artificial sound, which could be rendered scale-invariant. We generated a random chirp stimulus: an auditory signal controlled by two parameters, Q, controlling the relative, and r, controlling the absolute, temporal structure of the sound. Imposing scale-invariant statistics on the artificial sound was required for its perception as natural and water-like. Further, Q had to be restricted to a specific range for the sound to be perceived as natural. To detect self-similarity in the water sound, and identify Q, the auditory system needs to process the temporal dynamics of the waveform across spectral bands in terms of the number of cycles, rather than absolute timing. We propose a two-stage neural model implementing this computation. This computation may be carried out by circuits of neurons in the auditory cortex. The set of auditory stimuli developed in this study are particularly suitable for measurements of response properties of neurons in the auditory pathway, allowing for quantification of the effects of varying the statistics of the spectro-temporal statistical structure of the stimulus.},

These features include a left-hemisphere bias towards conspecific vocalizations, the use of temporal features for identifying different calls, and the use of calls to refer to objects and events in the environment. The putative neural bases for some of these behaviors have been revealed by recent studies of the primate auditory and prefrontal cortices. These studies also suggest homologies with the human language circuitry. Thus, a synthesis of cognitive, ethological and neurobiological approaches to primate vocal behavior is likely to yield the richest understanding of the neural bases of speech perception, and might also shed light on the evolutionary precursors to language.},

Here we present CaImAn, an open-source library for calcium imaging data analysis. CaImAn provides automatic and scalable methods to address problems common to pre-processing, including motion correction, neural activity identification, and registration across different sessions of data collection. It does this while requiring minimal user intervention, with good performance on computers ranging from laptops to high-performance computing clusters. CaImAn is suitable for two-photon and one-photon imaging, and also enables real-time analysis on streaming data. To benchmark the performance of CaImAn, we collected a corpus of ground truth annotations from multiple labelers on nine mouse two-photon datasets. We demonstrate that CaImAn achieves near-human performance in detecting locations of active neurons.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in understanding the structure of neural representations in the cerebral cortex has centred around the application of multivariate classification analyses to measurements of brain activity. These analyses have proved a sensitive test of whether given brain regions provide information about specific perceptual or cognitive processes. An exciting extension of this approach is to infer the structure of this information, thereby drawing conclusions about the underlying neural representational space. These approaches rely on exploratory data-driven dimensionality reduction to extract the natural dimensions of neural spaces, including natural visual object and scene representations, semantic and conceptual knowledge, and working memory. However, the efficacy of these exploratory methods is unknown, because they have only been applied to representations in brain areas for which we have little or no secondary knowledge. One of the best-understood areas of the cerebral cortex is area MT of primate visual cortex, which is known to be important in motion analysis. To assess the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction for recovering neural representational space we applied several dimensionality reduction methods to multielectrode measurements of spiking activity obtained from area MT of marmoset monkeys, made while systematically varying the motion direction and speed of moving stimuli. Despite robust tuning at individual electrodes, and high classifier performance, dimensionality reduction rarely revealed dimensions for direction and speed. We use this example to illustrate important limitations of these analyses, and suggest a framework for how to best apply such methods to data where the structure of the neural representation is unknown.},

For years, researchers have tried to identify the basic building-block of speech perception. In that time, experimental methods have evolved, constraints on stimulus materials have evolved, sources of variance have been identified, and computational models have been advanced. As a result, the slate of candidate units has increased, each with its own empirical support. In this article, we endorse Grossberg's adaptive resonance theory (ART), proposing that speech units are emergent properties of perceptual dynamics. By this view, units only "exist" when disparate features achieve resonance, a level of perceptual coherence that allows conscious encoding. We outline basic principles of ART, then summarize five experiments. Three experiments assessed the power of social influence to affect phonemesyllable competitions. Two other experiments assessed repetition effects in monitoring data. Together the data suggest that "primary" speech units are strongly and symmetrically affected by bottom-up and top-down knowledge sources. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In light of the well-known expansion of information in the life sciences and the need for metadata to enhance its value, these repositories present a potentially valuable new resource for application developers. Here we characterize the current contents of two scientifically relevant metadata repositories created through social tagging.

  abstract = {In order to investigate how the auditory scene is analyzed and perceived, auditory spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) are generally used as a convenient way to describe how frequency and temporal sound information is encoded. However, using broadband sounds to estimate STRFs imperfectly reflects the way neurons process complex stimuli like conspecific vocalizations insofar as natural sounds often show limited bandwidth. Using recordings in the primary auditory cortex of anesthetized cats, we show that presentation of narrowband stimuli not including the best frequency of neurons provokes the appearance of residual peaks and increased firing rate at some specific spectral edges of stimuli compared with classical STRFs obtained from broadband stimuli. This result is the same for STRFs obtained from both spikes and local field potentials. Potential mechanisms likely involve release from inhibition. We thus emphasize some aspects of context dependency of STRFs, that is, how the balance of inhibitory and excitatory inputs is able to shape the neural response from the spectral content of stimuli.},

This research led to the emergence of the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks as a possible solution, upon which several OSNs such as LifeSocial.KOM, Safebook, PeerSoN among others were based. In this article, we define the basic requirements for an P2P OSN. We then revisit one of the first P2P-based OSNs, LifeSocial.KOM, that is now called LibreSocial, which evolved in the past years to address the challenges of running a completely decentralized social network. Over the course of time, several essential new technologies have been incorporated within LibreSocial for better functionalities. In this article we describe the architecture and each individual component of LibreSocial and point out how LibreSocial meets the basic requirements for a fully functional distributed OSN.},

Of these, simulations on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms have been the cornerstone of scientific computing for more than two decades. However, the development of simulation software has, in general, occurred through accretion, with a few exceptions. With an increase in scientific understanding, models have become more complex, rendering an accretion mode untenable to the point where software productivity and sustainability have become active concerns in scientific computing. In this survey paper, we examine a modest set of HPC scientific simulation applications that are already using cutting-edge HPC platforms. Several have been in existence for a decade or more. Our objective in this survey is twofold: first, to understand the landscape of scientific computing on HPC platforms in order to distill the currently scattered knowledge about software practices that have helped both developer and software productivity, and second, to understand the kind of tools and methodologies that need attention for continued productivity.},

This article reviews classical and recent developments of ART, and provides a synthesis of concepts, principles, mechanisms, architectures, and the interdisciplinary data bases that they have helped to explain and predict. The review illustrates that ART is currently the most highly developed cognitive and neural theory available, with the broadest explanatory and predictive range. Central to ART's predictive power is its ability to carry out fast, incremental, and stable unsupervised and supervised learning in response to a changing world. ART specifies mechanistic links between processes of consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony during both unsupervised and supervised learning. ART provides functional and mechanistic explanations of such diverse topics as laminar cortical circuitry; invariant object and scenic gist learning and recognition; prototype, surface, and boundary attention; gamma and beta oscillations; learning of entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells; computation of homologous spatial and temporal mechanisms in the entorhinal-hippocampal system; vigilance breakdowns during autism and medial temporal amnesia; cognitive-emotional interactions that focus attention on valued objects in an adaptively timed way; item-order-rank working memories and learned list chunks for the planning and control of sequences of linguistic, spatial, and motor information; conscious speech percepts that are influenced by future context; auditory streaming in noise during source segregation; and speaker normalization. Brain regions that are functionally described include visual and auditory neocortex; specific and nonspecific thalamic nuclei; inferotemporal, parietal, prefrontal, entorhinal, hippocampal, parahippocampal, perirhinal, and motor cortices; frontal eye fields; supplementary eye fields; amygdala; basal ganglia: cerebellum; and superior colliculus. Due to the complementary organization of the brain, ART does not describe many spatial and motor behaviors whose matching and learning laws differ from those of ART.

This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-making in healthcare.},

  abstract = {Psychology endeavors to develop theories of human capacities and behaviors on the basis of a variety of methodologies and dependent measures. We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined\textemdash what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.},

Specifically, the restrictiveness of the encyclopedia's primary quality control mechanism and the algorithmic tools used to reject contributions are implicated as key causes of decreased newcomer retention.

In response to more general recent calls for a critical politics of data we focus our enquiry as follows: first, we explore how sociological analysis of the artefacts and tools that are currently being developed to build a Semantic Web helps us to uncover the potential effects of this `next generation' web on knowledge, data and expertise; and second we consider what a Semantic Web might offer to sociological research. We conclude by considering some implications of multidisciplinary engagement with the Web for the future of sociology.},

  abstract = {The Frame Problem, the issue of handling assumptions about time in artificial intelligence has proven remarkably difficult to formalize, and there is already a need to make temporally-qualified statements using metadata and ontologies. ion is both a benefit and a curse for the Semantic Web, especially when classes and individuals are introduced by OWL. The question about whether to implement a knowledge representation as either abstract or concrete is subtle(Smith, 1996). For example, the ``Dartmouth School of Art'' can be thought of as an concrete instance of the class of all schools, or as a abstract class which remains the same regardless of the moving of the physical building or the change of staff. It then becomes unclear what one is referring in statements such as ``The Dartmouth School of Art is now specializing in sculpture'' or ``The Dartmouth School of Art has changed its address.'' This problem is recognized by the OWL ontology group. The OWL documentation mentions both that ``in certain contexts something that is obviously a class can itself be considered an instance of something else'' and ``it is very easy to confuse the instance-of relationship with the subclass relationship''(Welty et al., 2004). This makes ontology mapping and merging exceedingly difficult. While the ability to divide the world into classes and instances provide description logics with a set of principles, it does not make mapping between what one person considers a class and another considers an instance straightforward. 5.4 The Frame Problem The question of how to represent time in an open world is another question from artificial intelligence that haunts the Semantic Web. RDF attempts to avoid this problem by stating that ``does not provide any analysis of time-varying data''(Hayes, 2004). Yet, it would seem that any statement about an URI is not meant to last forever, especially as URIs and their contents have a tendency to change. Berners-Lee attempts to avoid this problem in a note ``Cool URIs don't Change,''4 in which he notes that the change of a URI damages its ability to be universally linked and have statements made about it. However, despite this principle being made fundamental in new Web standards, it at the current moment does not stand true about the Web and we have no reason to believe that it will soon in the future(Jacobs and Walsh, 2004). There is already a need to make temporally-qualified statements using metadata and ontologies. However, as pointed out by the Frame Problem, the issue of handling assumptions 4http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI about time in artificial intelligence has proven remarkably difficult to formalize (McCarthy and Hayes, 1969). Their example is that if ``we had a number of actions to be performed in sequence we would have quite a number of conditions to write down that certain actions do not change the values of certain fluents''(McCarthy and Hayes, 1969). There is no agreed upon model of time with properties that are well understood. In fact, there are many theories of time with contradictory properties(Hayes, 1995). 5.5 The Symbol Grounding Problem This problem is stated as ``How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols?''(Harnad, 1990). One answer is to map it via formal semantics to a model theory. However, although the model may resemble the part of the world that it models, it could also may model it in a limited fashion due to the Knowledge Representation problem. Therefore, it is needed to ``ground'' the symbols in some real world object(Davis et al., 1993). It is difficult to imagine how what this would practically entail, perhaps some form of sensors with direct causal content as Harnad suggests(1990). However, it is not clear that such as direct connection is needed, for even humans do not remain in constant causal contact with their subject matter. In fact, this ability to connect and disconnect our representations with their subject matter is a reason for the origins of intentionality and representations in humans(Smith, 1996). A machine must use whatever information it can find out about the subject matter, even if that information is by nature partial. Although direct causal contact is limited by machines on the Web to those things that are Web accessible, it could include various statements (and entailments) encoded in the Semantic Web by humans and the immense amount of content created on the Web by human users about real world content. This gives the Semantic Web the ability to skirt around the problem by using Web accessible information that is grounded in human authority and human sensory contact with the world outside the Web, although it is far from a satisfactory solution. 5.6 The Problem of Trust This problem is virtually non-existent in AI since most knowledge representation systems were created by small groups who trusted their members. With the decentralization of ontology creation and the ability for ontologies to universally import, use, and perhaps map and merge to each other, there is a real need to know if the creator of some ontology is trustworthy. This leads to serious issues with ontology evaluation and has been one of the reasons concepts like reification in RDF were originally pursued. 5.7 Engineering or Epistemology? The Semantic Web may not be able to solve many of these problems. Many Semantic Web researchers pride themselves on being engineers as opposed to artificial intelligence researchers, logicians, or philosophers, and have been known to believe that many of these problems are engineering problems. While there may be suitable formalizations for time and ways of dealing with higher-order logic, the problems of knowledge representation and abstraction appear to be epistemological characteristics of the world that are ultimately resistant to any solution. It may be impossible to solve some of these problems satisfactorily, yet having awareness of these problems can only help the development of the Web.},

We present four perspectives in defense of dRDM, illustrating that, in contrast to centralized or federated research data management solutions, a dRDM system based on heterogeneous but interoperable components can offer a sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and adaptive infrastructure for scientific stakeholders: An individual scientist or laboratory, a research institute, a domain data archive or cloud computing platform, and a collaborative multisite consortium. All perspectives share the use of a common, self-contained, portable data structure as an abstraction from current technology and service choices. In conjunction, the four perspectives review how varying requirements of independent scientific stakeholders can be addressed by a scalable, uniform dRDM solution and present a working system as an exemplary implementation.},

  abstract = {This article reports a cross-cultural analysis of four Wikipedias in different languages and demonstrates their roles as communities of practice (CoPs). Prior research on CoPs and on the Wikipedia community often lacks cross-cultural analysis. Despite the fact that over 75\% of Wikipedia is written in languages other than English, research on Wikipedia primarily focuses on the English Wikipedia and tends to overlook Wikipedias in other languages. This article first argues that Wikipedia communities can be analyzed and understood as CoPs. Second, norms of behaviors are examined in four Wikipedia languages (English, Hebrew, Japanese, and Malay), and the similarities and differences across these four languages are reported. Specifically, typical behaviors on three types of discussion spaces (talk, user talk, and Wikipedia talk) are identified and examined across languages. Hofstede's dimensions of cultural diversity as well as the size of the community and the function of each discussion area provide lenses for understanding the similarities and differences. As such, this article expands the research on online CoPs through an examination of cultural variations across multiple CoPs and increases our understanding of Wikipedia communities in various languages.},

It is involved in any task that calls for differential responding, from operant discrimination to pattern recognition to naming and describing objects and states-of-affairs. Explanations of categorization range from nativist theories denying that any nontrivial categories are acquired by learning to inductivist theories claiming that most categories are learned. "Categorical perception" (CP) is the name given to a suggestive perceptual phenomenon that may serve as a useful model for categorization in general: For certain perceptual categories, within-category differences look much smaller than between-category differences even when they are of the same size physically. For example, in color perception, differences between reds and differences between yellows look much smaller than equal-sized differences that cross the red/yellow boundary; the same is true of the phoneme categories /ba/ and /da/. Indeed, the effect of the category boundary is not merely quantitative, but qualitative.},

The current article-based system technically fulfills these functions, but suboptimally. I propose a module-based communication infrastructure that attempts to take a wider view of these functions and optimize the fulfillment of the five functions of scholarly communication. Scholarly modules are conceptualized as the constituent parts of a research process as determined by a researcher. These can be text, but also code, data, and any other relevant pieces of information that are produced in the research process. The chronology of these modules is registered by iteratively linking to each other, creating a provenance record of parent and child modules (and a network of modules). These scholarly modules are linked to scholarly profiles, creating a network of profiles, and a network of how profiles relate to their constituent modules. All these scholarly modules would be communicated on the new peer-to-peer Web protocol Dat, which provides a decentralized register that is immutable, facilitates greater content integrity than the current system through verification, and is open-by-design. Open-by-design would also allow diversity in the way content is consumed, discovered, and evaluated to arise. This initial proposal needs to be refined and developed further based on the technical developments of the Dat protocol, its implementations, and discussions within the scholarly community to evaluate the qualities claimed here. Nonetheless, a minimal prototype is available today, and this is technically feasible.},

This is a necessary step towards unified access to biological data sets, but this still requires solutions to query multiple endpoints for their heterogeneous data to eventually retrieve all the meaningful information. Suggested solutions are based on query federation approaches, which require the submission of SPARQL queries to endpoints. Due to the size and complexity of available data, these solutions have to be optimised for efficient retrieval times and for users in life sciences research. Last but not least, over time, the reliability of data resources in terms of access and quality have to be monitored. Our solution (BioFed) federates data over 130 SPARQL endpoints in life sciences and tailors query submission according to the provenance information. BioFed has been evaluated against the state of the art solution FedX and forms an important benchmark for the life science domain.},

  abstract = {One view of speech perception is that acoustic signals are transformed into representations for pattern matching to determine linguistic structure. This process can be taken as a statistical pattern-matching problem, assuming realtively stable linguistic categories are characterized by neural representations related to auditory properties of speech that can be compared to speech input. This kind of pattern matching can be termed a passive process which implies rigidity of processing with few demands on cognitive processing. An alternative view is that speech recognition, even in early stages, is an active process in which speech analysis is attentionally guided. Note that this does not mean consciously guided but that information-contingent changes in early auditory encoding can occur as a function of context and experience. Active processing assumes that attention, plasticity, and listening goals are important in considering how listeners cope with adverse circumstances that impair hearing by masking noise in the environment or hearing loss. Although theories of speech perception have begun to incorporate some active processing, they seldom treat early speech encoding as plastic and attentionally guided. Recent research has suggested that speech perception is the product of both feedforward and feedback interactions between a number of brain regions that include descending projections perhaps as far downstream as the cochlea. It is important to understand how the ambiguity of the speech signal and constraints of context dynamically determine cognitive resources recruited during perception including focused attention, learning, and working memory. Theories of speech perception need to go beyond the current corticocentric approach in order to account for the intrinsic dynamics of the auditory encoding of speech. In doing so, this may provide new insights into ways in which hearing disorders and loss may be treated either through augementation or therapy.},

To identify these core dimensions of object representations, we developed a data-driven computational model of similarity judgements for real-world images of 1,854 objects. The model captured most explainable variance in similarity judgements and produced 49 highly reproducible and meaningful object dimensions that reflect various conceptual and perceptual properties of those objects. These dimensions predicted external categorization behaviour and reflected typicality judgements of those categories. Furthermore, humans can accurately rate objects along these dimensions, highlighting their interpretability and opening up a way to generate similarity estimates from object dimensions alone. Collectively, these results demonstrate that human similarity judgements can be captured by a fairly low-dimensional, interpretable embedding that generalizes to external behaviour.},

Most such models have their roots in linear-systems approaches pioneered in the retina by C. Enroth-Cugell and J. R. Robson [(1966) J. Physiol. (London) 187, 517-552], but it is clear that purely linear models of cortical neurons are inadequate. We present two related models: one designed to account for the responses of simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) and one designed to account for the responses of pattern direction selective cells in MT (or V5), an extrastriate visual area thought to be involved in the analysis of visual motion. These models share a common structure that operates in the same way on different kinds of input, and instantiate the widely held view that computational strategies are similar throughout the cerebral cortex. Implementations of these models for Macintosh microcomputers are available and can be used to explore the models' properties.},

We consider the effects that such a change will have on the social structure of science, paying particular attention to the changed incentive structure and the likely effects on the behaviour of individual scientists. We evaluate these changes from the perspective of epistemic consequentialism. We find that where the effects of abolishing prepublication peer review can be evaluated with a reasonable level of confidence based on presently available evidence, they are either positive or neutral.

  abstract = {An approach to the coordinated sharing and interchange of computerized information is described emphasizing partial, controlled sharing among autonomous databases. Office information systems provide a particularly appropriate context for this type of information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis.},

This study, however, focused on less explored themes, namely on alternative funding mechanisms for scientific research and on emerging reputation mechanisms for scholars resulting from Web 2.0 platforms and applications. It has been demonstrated that both are providing significant new opportunities for researchers to disseminate, share, explore and collaborate with other researchers, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to bring about more disruptive change in how science and research systems function in the future. They could well do so, especially if related changes being considered by the European Commission on Science 2.0: Science in Transition are taken into account.},

  abstract = {Speech recognition is an active process that involves some form of predictive coding. This statement is relatively uncontroversial. What is less clear is the source of the prediction. The dual-stream model of speech processing suggests that there are two possible sources of predictive coding in speech perception: the motor speech system and the lexical-conceptual system. Here I provide an overview of the dual-stream model of speech processing and then discuss evidence concerning the source of predictive coding during speech recognition. I conclude that, in contrast to recent theoretical trends, the dorsal sensory-motor stream is not a source of forward prediction that can facilitate speech recognition. Rather, it is forward prediction coming out of the ventral stream that serves this function.Learning outcomes: Readers will (1) be able to explain the dual route model of speech processing including the function of the dorsal and ventral streams in language processing, (2) describe how disruptions to certain components of the dorsal stream can cause conduction aphasia, (3) be able to explain the fundamental principles of state feedback control in motor behavior, and (4) identify the role of predictive coding in motor control and in perception and how predictive coding coming out of the two streams may have different functional consequences. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Computer crime has increased exponentially in recent years as hardware, software, and network resources become more affordable and available to individuals from all walks of life. Software piracy is one prevalent type of cybercrime and has detrimentally affected the economic health of the software industry. Moreover, piracy arguably represents a rend in the moral fabric associated with the respect of intellectual property and reduces the financial incentive of product creation and innovation. Deindividuation theory, originating from the field of social psychology, argues that individuals are extricated from responsibility for their actions simply because they no longer have an acute awareness of the identity of self and of others. That is, external and internal constraints that would typically regulate questionable behavior are rendered less effective via certain anonymizing and disinhibiting conditions of the social and environmental context. This exploratory piece seeks to establish the role of deindividuation in liberating individuals to commit software piracy by testing the hypothesis that persons who prefer the anonymity and pseudonymity associated with interaction on the Internet are more likely to pirate software. Through this research, it is hoped that the empirical identification of such a social psychological determinant will help further illuminate the phenomenon.},

We leverage this idea to provide an analysis of partitions in neuronal systems. This is applicable to brain architectures at multiple scales, enabling partitions into single neurons, brain regions, and brain-wide networks. This treatment is based upon the canonical micro-circuitry used in empirical studies of effective connectivity, so as to speak directly to practical applications. This depends upon the dynamic coupling between functional units, whose form recapitulates that of a Markov blanket at each level. The nuance afforded by partitioning neural systems in this way highlights certain limitations of modular perspectives of brain function that only consider a single level of description.},

The present study examines the basis of this observation. One hypothesis is that lower f0's enhance perception of voiced stops by virtue of perceptual interactions that arise from the operating characteristics of the auditory system. A second hypothesis is that this perceptual pattern develops as a result of experience with f0-voicing covariation. In a test of these hypotheses, Japanese quail learned to respond to stimuli drawn from a series varying in VOT through training with one of three patterns of f0-voicing covariation. Voicing and f0 varied in the natural pattern (shorter VOT, lower f0), in an inverse pattern (shorter VOT, higher f0), or in a random pattern (no f0-voicing covariation). Birds trained with stimuli that had no f0-voicing ...},

Four experiments investigated how preceding sequences of sine-wave tones influence phonetic categorization. This experimental paradigm provides a means of investigating the statistical regularities of acoustic events that influence online speech categorization and, reciprocally, reveals regularities of the sound environment tracked by auditory processing. The tones comprising the sequences were drawn from distributions sampling different acoustic frequencies. Results indicate that whereas the mean of the distributions predicts contrastive shifts in speech categorization, variability of the distributions has little effect. Moreover, speech categorization is influenced by the global mean of the tone sequence, without significant influence of local statistical regularities within the tone sequence. Further arguing that the effect is strongly related to the average spectrum of the sequence, notched noise spectral complements of the tone sequences produce a complementary effect on speech categorization. Lastly, these effects are modulated by the number of tones in the acoustic history and the overall duration of the sequence, but not by the density with which the distribution defining the sequence is sampled. Results are discussed in light of stimulus-specific adaptation to statistical regularity in the acoustic input and a speculative link to talker normalization is postulated.},

  abstract = {Four experiments explored the relative contributions of spectral content and phonetic labeling in effects of context on vowel perception. Two 10-step series of CVC syllables ([bVb] and [dVd]) varying acoustically in F2 midpoint frequency and varying perceptually in vowel height from [delta] to [epsilon] were synthesized. In a forced-choice identification task, listeners more often labeled vowels as [delta] in [dVd] context than in [bVb] context. To examine whether spectral content predicts this effect, nonspeech-speech hybrid series were created by appending 70-ms sine-wave glides following the trajectory of CVC F2's to 60-ms members of a steady-state vowel series varying in F2 frequency. In addition, a second hybrid series was created by appending constant-frequency sine-wave tones equivalent in frequency to CVC F2 onset/offset frequencies. Vowels flanked by frequency-modulated glides or steady-state tones modeling [dVd] were more often labeled as [delta] than were the same vowels surrounded by nonspeech modeling [bVb]. These results suggest that spectral content is important in understanding vowel context effects. A final experiment tested whether spectral content can modulate vowel perception when phonetic labeling remains intact. Voiceless consonants, with lower-amplitude more-diffuse spectra, were found to exert less of an influence on vowel perception than do their voiced counterparts. The data are discussed in terms of a general perceptual account of context effects in speech perception.},

This is an example of categorization, in that potentially discriminable speech sounds are assigned to functionally equivalent classes. In this tutorial, we present some of the main challenges to our understanding of the categorization of speech sounds and the conceptualization of SP that has resulted from these challenges. We focus here on issues and experiments that define open research questions relevant to phoneme categorization, arguing that SP is best understood as perceptual categorization, a position that places SP in direct contact with research from other areas of perception and cognition.},

  abstract = {Speech perception is an ecologically important example of the highly context-dependent nature of perception; adjacent speech, and even nonspeech, sounds influence how listeners categorize speech. Some theories emphasize linguistic or articulation-based processes in speech-elicited context effects and peripheral (cochlear) auditory perceptual interactions in non-speech-elicited context effects. The present studies challenge this division. Results of three experiments indicate that acoustic histories composed of sine-wave tones drawn from spectral distributions with different mean frequencies robustly affect speech categorization. These context effects were observed even when the acoustic context temporally adjacent to the speech stimulus was held constant and when more than a second of silence or multiple intervening sounds separated the nonlinguistic acoustic context and speech targets. These experiments indicate that speech categorization is sensitive to statistical distributions of spectral information, even if the distributions are composed of nonlinguistic elements. Acoustic context need be neither linguistic nor local to influence speech perception.},

However, in such a database system, the set of information tuples in the universe is partitioned over many distributed nodes, for reasons including autonomy, scalability, availability, performance and security. It is not obvious how to enable generalpurpose discovery query support and collective collaborative functionality that operate on the distributed system as a whole, rather than on a given part of it. Further, it is not obvious how to allow for search results that are fresh, allowing dynamic content. It appears that a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) database network may be well suited to support dynamic distributed database search, for example for service discovery. In this paper, we devise the Unified Peer-to-Peer Database Framework (UPDF), which allows to express specific applications for arbitrary query languages (e.g. XQuery, SQL) and node topologies, and a wide range of data types, query response modes (e.g. Routed, Direct and Referral Response), neighbor selection policies, pipelining characteristics, timeout and other scope options.},

We examine the software ecosystem surrounding BLAST, a key bioinformatics tool, identifying outside improvements and interviewing their authors. We find that academic credit is a powerful motivator for the production and revealing of improvements. Yet surprisingly, we also find that improvements motivated by academic credit are less likely to be integrated than those with other motivations, including financial gain. We argue that this is because integration makes it harder to see who has contributed what and thereby undermines the ability of reputation to function as a reward for collaboration. We consider how open source avoids these issues and conclude with policy approaches to promoting wider collaboration by addressing incentives for integration.},

Just as with data, the visibility of software in publications is related to incentives to share software in reusable ways, and so promote efficient science. In this article, we examine software in publications through content analysis of a random sample of 90 biology articles. We develop a coding scheme to identify software ``mentions'' and classify them according to their characteristics and ability to realize the functions of citations. Overall, we find diverse and problematic practices: Only between 31\% and 43\% of mentions involve formal citations; informal mentions are very common, even in high impact factor journals and across different kinds of software. Software is frequently inaccessible (15\%\textendash 29\% of packages in any form; between 90\% and 98\% of specific versions; only between 24\%\textendash 40\% provide source code). Cites to publications are particularly poor at providing version information, whereas informal mentions are particularly poor at providing crediting information. We provide recommendations to improve the practice of software citation, highlighting recent nascent efforts. Software plays an increasingly great role in scientific practice; it deserves a clear and useful place in scholarly communication.},

In an experiment that employed a novel method of housing and testing, pigeons were trained to discriminate between two sets of Brunswik faces that differed along four dimensions, each represented by three values. The category rule was defined as an additive combination (sum) of the four feature values and thus resembles the polymorphous m-out-of-n rule. In the course of training, the birds tended to classify members of the categories according to their feature sum. This result was confirmed by the fact that the weightings assigned to each feature were similar in the final stage of training. A multiple regression analysis of the response rates enabled the classification decisions of the pigeons to be predicted from the linear feature model in accordance with feature learning theory.},

  abstract = {Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase responsible for the de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats. In addition to its established reverse transcriptase and terminal transferase activities, recent reports have revealed unexpected cellular activities of telomerase, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerization. This telomerase characteristic, distinct from other reverse transcriptases, indicates that clinically relevant reverse transcriptase inhibitors might have unexpected telomerase inhibition profiles. This is particularly important for the newer generation of RT inhibitors designed for anti-HIV therapy, which have reported higher safety margins than older agents. Using an in vitro primer extension assay, we tested the effects of clinically relevant HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors on cellular telomerase activity. We observed that all commonly used nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including zidovudine, stavudine, tenofovir, didanosine and abacavir, inhibit telomerase effectively in vitro. Truncated telomere synthesis was consistent with the expected mode of inhibition by all tested NRTIs. Through dose-response experiments, we established relative inhibitory potencies of NRTIs on in vitro telomerase activity as compared to the inhibitory potencies of the corresponding dideoxynucleotide triphosphates. In contrast to NRTIs, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine and efavirenz did not inhibit the primer extension activity of telomerase, even at millimolar concentrations. Long-term, continuous treatment of human HT29 cells with select NRTIs resulted in an accelerated loss of telomere repeats. All tested NRTIs exhibited the same rank order of inhibitory potencies on telomerase and HIV RT, which, according to published data, were orders-of-magnitude more sensitive than other DNA polymerases, including the susceptible mitochondria-specific DNA polymerase gamma. We concluded that telomerase activity could be inhibited by common NRTIs, including currently recommended RTI agents tenofovir and abacavir, which warrants large-scale clinical and epidemiological investigation of the off-target effects of long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with these agents.},

  abstract = {Motor learning involves reorganization of the primary motor cortex (M1). However, it remains unclear how the involvement of M1 in movement control changes during long-term learning. To address this, we trained mice in a forelimb-based motor task over months and performed optogenetic inactivation and two-photon calcium imaging in M1 during the long-term training. We found that M1 inactivation impaired the forelimb movements in the early and middle stages, but not in the late stage, indicating that the movements that initially required M1 became independent of M1. As previously shown, M1 population activity became more consistent across trials from the early to middle stage while task performance rapidly improved. However, from the middle to late stage, M1 population activity became again variable despite consistent expert behaviors. This later decline in activity consistency suggests dissociation between M1 and movements. These findings suggest that long-term motor learning can disengage M1 from movement control. Long-term training of motor skills reorganizes motor circuits to bypass primary motor cortex. Long-term training of motor skills reorganizes motor circuits to bypass primary motor cortex.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

This paper presents a different approach to vowel reduction in Standard Russian. It is proposed that the apparent sonority-driven effects in Russian are epiphenomenal. In particular, reduction to schwa is outside the domain of phonological computation in Russian, being an artifact of reduced duration. Other types of neutralization arising in vowel reduction are potentially amenable to a sonority-based analysis, but I argue that current approaches to sonority-driven reduction suffer from representational shortcomings. When these shortcomings are rectified, however, sonority is unnecessary as an explicit factor in vowel reduction: standard markedness mechanisms suffice to explain the data.},

  abstract = {Over the last 30 years a wide range of manipulations of auditory input and experience have been shown to result in plasticity in auditory cortical and subcortical structures. The time course of plasticity ranges from very rapid stimulus-specific adaptation to longer-term changes associated with, for example, partial hearing loss or perceptual learning. Evidence for plasticity as a consequence of these and a range of other manipulations of auditory input and/or its significance is reviewed, with an emphasis on plasticity in adults and in the auditory cortex. The nature of the changes in auditory cortex associated with attention, memory and perceptual learning depend critically on task structure, reward contingencies, and learning strategy. Most forms of auditory system plasticity are adaptive, in that they serve to optimize auditory performance, prompting attempts to harness this plasticity for therapeutic purposes. However, plasticity associated with cochlear trauma and partial hearing loss appears to be maladaptive, and has been linked to tinnitus. Three important forms of human learning-related auditory system plasticity are those associated with language development, musical training, and improvement in performance with a cochlear implant. Almost all forms of plasticity involve changes in synaptic excitatory - inhibitory balance within existing patterns of connectivity. An attractive model applicable to a number of forms of learning-related plasticity is dynamic multiplexing by individual neurons, such that learning involving a particular stimulus attribute reflects a particular subset of the diverse inputs to a given neuron being gated by top-down influences. The plasticity evidence indicates that auditory cortex is a component of complex distributed networks that integrate the representation of auditory stimuli with attention, decision and reward processes.},

  abstract = {Auditory brainstem-evoked response (ABR) thresholds were obtained in a longitudinal study of C57BL/6J mice between 10 and 53 weeks old, with repeated testing every 2 weeks. On alternate weeks, acoustic startle reflex (ASR) amplitudes were measured, elicited by tone pips with stimulus frequencies of 3, 6, 12, and 24 kHz, and intensities from subthreshold up to 110 dB sound pressure level. The increase in ABR thresholds for 3 and 6 kHz test stimuli followed a linear time course with increasing age from 10 to 53 weeks, with a slope of about 0.7 dB/week, and for 48 kHz a second linear time course, but beginning at 10 weeks with a slope of about 2.3 dB/week. ABR thresholds for 12, 24, and 32 kHz increased after one linear segment with a 0.7 dB slope, then after a variable delay related to the test frequency, shifted to a second segment having slopes of 3-5 dB/week. Hearing loss initially reduced the ASR for all eliciting stimuli, but at about 6 months of age, the response elicited by intense 3 and 6 kHz stimuli began to increase to reach values about three times above normal, and previously subthreshold stimuli came to elicit vigorous responses seen at first only for the intense stimuli. This hyperacusis-like effect appeared in all mice but was especially pronounced in mice with more serious hearing loss. These ABR data, together with a review of histopathological data in the C57BL/6 literature, suggest that the non-frequency-specific slow time course of hearing loss results from pathology in the lateral wall of the cochlea, whereas the stimulus-specific hearing loss with a rapid time course results from hair cell loss. Delayed exaggeration of the ASR with hearing loss reveals a deficit in centrifugal inhibitory control over the afferent reflex pathways after central neural reorganization, suggesting that this mouse may provide a useful model of age-related tinnitus and associated hyperacusis.},

Jackson surveys an extraordinary range of annotated books to explore the history of marginalia, the forms they take, the psychology that underlies them, and the reactions they provoke.Based on a study of thousands of books annotated by readers both famous and obscure over the last three centuries, this book reveals the intensity of emotion that characterizes the process of reading. For hundreds of years, readers have talked to other people in the margins of their books--not only to authors, but also to friends, lovers, and future generations.With an infectious enthusiasm for her subject, Jackson reflects on the cultural and historical value of writing in the margins, examines works that have invited passionate annotation, and presents examples of some of the most provocative marginalia. Imaginative, amusing, and poignant, this book will be treasured by--and maybe even annotated by--anyone who cares about reading.},

The article reports the findings of a survey of the opinions and practices of 251 European scholars about this emerging scholarly market. Findings showed that traditional research-related activities, including conducting and collaborating in research, taking part in multidisciplinary projects, and publishing in journals contribute most to scholarly reputation. The greatest weaknesses of reputational platforms were a lack of trustworthiness and being open to gaming. The large majority of researchers, despite some reservations, thought that reputational systems were here to stay and will become increasingly important in the future, and especially for younger researchers.},

It has been demonstrated that communities that adopt SRE are greatly oversupplied, i.e., they have much higher seeder-to-leecher ratios than communities in which SRE is not employed. Most previous studies focus on showing the positive effect of SRE in achieving high downloading speed. However, in this paper we show through measurements that SRE also induces severe side-effects. Under SRE, users are forced to seed for excessively long times to maintain adequate sharing ratios to be able to start new downloads, though most of the time their seedings are not very productive (in terms of low upload speed). We also observe that many users who seed for very long times still have low sharing ratios. We find that this is due to the counter-intuitive phenomenon that long seeding times do not necessarily lead to large upload amounts. Based on these observations, we discuss possible strategies for users to gain sharing ratios efficiently, which help them to survive and thrive in private communities.},

In this paper, we argue that a new specialization should be formed within ML that is focused on methodologies for data collection and annotation: efforts that require institutional frameworks and procedures. Specifically for sociocultural data, parallels can be drawn from archives and libraries. Archives are the longest standing communal effort to gather human information and archive scholars have already developed the language and procedures to address and discuss many challenges pertaining to data collection such as consent, power, inclusivity, transparency, and ethics \& privacy. We discuss these five key approaches in document collection practices in archives that can inform data collection in sociocultural ML. By showing data collection practices from another field, we encourage ML research to be more cognizant and systematic in data collection and draw from interdisciplinary expertise.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the ethical implications of Google's Knowledge Graph. The paper argues that in the advent and implementation of said Knowledge Graph, the role of Google in users' lives and the power held by Google as the key intermediary of information must be scrutinized. Design/methodology/approach Revisiting existing literature on Google and its impact on knowledge culture, the paper seeks to assess whether the implementation of The Knowledge Graph represents a significant shift in the nature (or use) of the service. Findings The paper concludes that the extension to Google Search, The Knowledge Graph, can serve to radicalize Google's position as a key intermediary of information in users' lives. Rather than simply serving as a gatekeeper supplying the user with an array of links matching a given query, Google now conveniently disseminates information on their own site, roughly rendering the remainder of the web superfluous. Considering both the commercial nature and the opacity of the service, Google as a de facto solo editor of information is worrying from both a democratic and ethical perspective. A culture of emphatic insistence on convenience and consumption is likely to contribute to the impediment of autonomous information retrieval and digital literacy. Research limitations/implications The paper must be considered a preliminary inquiry into Google's reliability as an editor of the body of knowledge. As of yet, no literature specifically has remarked on The Knowledge Graph. Originality/value This paper examines whether the newest extension of Google Search, The Knowledge Graph, poses any significant changes to the assessment of the service and its role in the culture. Fostering critical, digital literacy in search engine users is deemed of even more vital importance to society with the implementation of The Knowledge Graph. This paper, preliminary and far from exhaustive, seeks to initiate a discussion on the future responsibilities of Google, scholars and users in securing the ideal of critical digital literacy.},

  abstract = {Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain regions in both superficial and deep structures. Existing extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca2+ imaging offers more coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address 960 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing-compatible low-impedance TiN sites that tile a single 10-mm long, 70\,\texttimes\,20-{$\mu$}m cross-section shank. The 6\,\texttimes\,9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path towards recording of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour.},

I argue here that research using functional MRI is beginning to answer this long-standing question with new clarity and precision by indicating that at least a few specific aspects of cognition are implemented in brain regions that are highly specialized for that process alone. Cortical regions have been identified that are specialized not only for basic sensory and motor processes but also for the high-level perceptual analysis of faces, places, bodies, visually presented words, and even for the very abstract cognitive function of thinking about another person's thoughts. I further consider the as-yet unanswered questions of how much of the mind and brain are made up of these functionally specialized components and how they arise developmentally.},

By requiring members to maintain a minimum ratio between uploads and downloads, private communities effectively establish credit systems, and with them full-fledged economies. We report on a half-year-long measurement study of DIME -- a community for sharing live concert recordings -- that sheds light on the economic forces affecting users in such communities. A key observation is that while the download of files is priced only according to the size of the file, the rate of return for seeding new files is significantly greater than for seeding old files. We find via a natural experiment that users react to such differences in resale value by preferentially consuming older files during a 'free leech' period. We consider implications of these finding on a user's ability to earn credits and meet ratio enforcements, focusing in particular on the relationship between visitation frequency and wealth and on low bandwidth users. We then share details from an interview with DIME moderators, which highlights the goals of the community based on which we make suggestions for possible improvement.},

The contexts are organized as a meet semi-lattice and associated operations like the greatest lower bound are defined.  The context of comparison and the type of abstractions used to relate the two objects form the basis of a semantic taxonomy.  At the semantic level, the intensional description of database objects provided by the context is expressed using description logics.  The terms used to construct the contexts are obtained from \{\textbackslash em domain-specific ontologies\}.Schema correspondences are used to store mappings from the semantic level to the data level and are associated with the respective contexts.  Inferences about database content at the federation level are modeled as changes in the context and the associated schema correspondences.  We try to reconcile the dual (schematic and semantic) perspectives by enumerating possible semantic similarities between objects having schema and data conflicts, and modeling schema correspondences as the projection of semantic proximity with respect to (wrt) context.},

Here we use chronic two-photon calcium imaging to explore how wakefulness and experience shape odor representations in the mouse olfactory bulb. Comparing the awake and anesthetized state, we show that wakefulness greatly enhances the activity of inhibitory granule cells and makes principal mitral cell odor responses more sparse and temporally dynamic. In awake mice, brief repeated odor experience leads to a gradual and long-lasting (months) weakening of mitral cell odor representations. This mitral cell plasticity is odor-specific, recovers gradually over months and can be repeated with different odors. Furthermore, the expression of this experience-dependent plasticity is prevented by anesthesia. Together, our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of mitral cell odor representations in awake animals, which is constantly shaped by recent odor experience.},

  abstract = {Neural oscillations track linguistic information during speech comprehension (Ding et al., 2016; Keitel et al., 2018), and are known to be modulated by acoustic landmarks and speech intelligibility (Doelling et al., 2014; Zoefel and VanRullen, 2015). However, studies investigating linguistic tracking have either relied on non-naturalistic isochronous stimuli or failed to fully control for prosody. Therefore, it is still unclear whether low-frequency activity tracks linguistic structure during natural speech, where linguistic structure does not follow such a palpable temporal pattern. Here, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) and manipulated the presence of semantic and syntactic information apart from the timescale of their occurrence, while carefully controlling for the acoustic-prosodic and lexical-semantic information in the signal. EEG was recorded while 29 adult native speakers (22 women, 7 men) listened to naturally spoken Dutch sentences, jabberwocky controls with morphemes and sentential prosody, word lists with lexical content but no phrase structure, and backward acoustically matched controls. Mutual information (MI) analysis revealed sensitivity to linguistic content: MI was highest for sentences at the phrasal (0.8\textendash 1.1 Hz) and lexical (1.9\textendash 2.8 Hz) timescales, suggesting that the delta-band is modulated by lexically driven combinatorial processing beyond prosody, and that linguistic content (i.e., structure and meaning) organizes neural oscillations beyond the timescale and rhythmicity of the stimulus. This pattern is consistent with neurophysiologically inspired models of language comprehension (Martin, 2016, 2020; Martin and Doumas, 2017) where oscillations encode endogenously generated linguistic content over and above exogenous or stimulus-driven timing and rhythm information. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Biological systems like the brain encode their environment not only by reacting in a series of stimulus-driven responses, but by combining stimulus-driven information with endogenous, internally generated, inferential knowledge and meaning. Understanding language from speech is the human benchmark for this. Much research focuses on the purely stimulus-driven response, but here, we focus on the goal of language behavior: conveying structure and meaning. To that end, we use naturalistic stimuli that contrast acoustic-prosodic and lexical-semantic information to show that, during spoken language comprehension, oscillatory modulations reflect computations related to inferring structure and meaning from the acoustic signal. Our experiment provides the first evidence to date that compositional structure and meaning organize the oscillatory response, above and beyond prosodic and lexical controls.},

However, the bulk of earlier research supporting their perceptual importance has been conducted primarily with synthetic speech stimuli. The present study examined the acoustic correlates of place of articulation in the voiced formant transitions from natural speech. Linear prediction analysis was used to provide detailed temporal and spectral measurements of the formant transitions for /b,d,g/ paired with eight vowels produced by one talker. Measurements of the transition onset and steady state frequencies, durations, and derived formant loci for F1, F2, and F3 are reported. Analysis of these measures showed little evidence of context invariant acoustic correlates of place. When vowel context was known, most transition parameters were not reliable acoustic correlates of place except for the F2 transition and a two-dimensional representation of F2 X F3 onset frequencies. The results indicated that the information contained in the formant transitions in these natural stop-vowel syllables was not sufficient to distinguish place across all the vowel contexts studied.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that voice fundamental frequency (fo), or pitch, relies on auditory feedback to monitor and correct for errors in production. When voice-pitch auditory feedback is unexpectedly perturbed, individuals typically produce a compensatory change in fo that opposes the direction of the pitch-perturbation. Studies comparing steady vowel vocalizations and speech tasks have demonstrated task-dependent modulation of the compensatory response, but the effects of planning to volitionally change fo during active vocalization have yet to be explored. Ten musicians and ten non-musicians were asked to perform two vocal tasks. Both tasks started off at a conversational fo. In one task, pitch-shifted feedback was presented when the participants were planning to hold fo constant (steady fo), and in the other, feedback was shifted while participants were in the planning stage prior to raising fo (raised fo) from a steady state. Acoustical analyses of fo were performed to measure the peak magnitude and latency of both the compensatory response as well as the voluntary fo change. Results showed that planning to change pitch modulates the mechanisms controlling feedback-based error correction of fo, and musicality affects how individuals incorporate modulations in auditory feedback with the feedforward plans to increase voice fo.},

  abstract = {Our ability to make sense of the auditory world results from neural processing that begins in the ear, goes through multiple subcortical areas, and continues in the cortex. The specific contribution of the auditory cortex to this chain of processing is far from understood. Although many of the properties of neurons in the auditory cortex resemble those of subcortical neurons, they show somewhat more complex selectivity for sound features, which is likely to be important for the analysis of natural sounds, such as speech, in real-life listening conditions. Furthermore, recent work has shown that auditory cortical processing is highly context-dependent, integrates auditory inputs with other sensory and motor signals, depends on experience, and is shaped by cognitive demands, such as attention. Thus, in addition to being the locus for more complex sound selectivity, the auditory cortex is increasingly understood to be an integral part of the network of brain regions responsible for prediction, auditory perceptual decision-making, and learning. In this review, we focus on three key areas that are contributing to this understanding: the sound features that are preferentially represented by cortical neurons, the spatial organization of those preferences, and the cognitive roles of the auditory cortex.},

This phenomenon is known as selective adaptation and is a well-studied property of speech perception. Traditionally, selective adaptation is seen as a mechanistic property of the speech perception system, and attributed to fatigue in acoustic-phonetic feature detectors. However, recent developments in our understanding of non-linguistic sensory adaptation and higher-level adaptive plasticity in speech perception and language comprehension suggest that it is time to re-visit the phenomenon of selective adaptation. We argue that selective adaptation is better thought of as a computational property of the speech perception system. Drawing on a common thread in recent work on both non-linguistic sensory adaptation and plasticity in language comprehension, we furthermore propose that selective adaptation can be seen as a consequence of distributional learning across multiple levels of representation. This proposal opens up new questions for research on selective adaptation itself, and also suggests that selective adaptation can be an important bridge between work on adaptation in low-level sensory systems and the complicated plasticity of the adult language comprehension system.},

  abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker's /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker's /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (a) recognizing previously encountered situations, (b) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (c) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (a) to (c) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on 2 critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires that listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these 2 aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.},

  abstract = {In May 1999, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Harold Varmus proposed an electronic repository for biomedical research literature server called ``E-biomed.'' E-biomed reflected the visions of scholarly electronic publishing advocates: It would be fully searchable, be free to readers, and contain full-text versions of both preprint and postpublication biomedical research articles. However, within 4 months, the E-biomed proposal was radically transformed: The preprint section was eliminated, delays were instituted between article publication and posting to the archive, and the name was changed to ``PubMed Central.'' This case study examines the remarkable transformation of the E-biomed proposal to PubMed Central by analyzing comments about the proposal that were posted to an online E-biomed forum created by the NIH, and discussions that took place in other face-to-face forums where E-biomed deliberations took place. We find that the transformation of the E-biomed proposal into PubMed Central was the result of highly visible and highly influential position statements made by scientific societies against the proposal. The literature about scholarly electronic publishing usually emphasizes a binary conflict between (trade) publishers and scholars/scientists. We conclude that: (1) scientific societies and the individual scientists they represent do not always have identical interests in regard to scientific e-publishing; (2) stakeholder politics and personal interests reign supreme in e-publishing debates, even in a supposedly status-free online forum; and (3) multiple communication forums must be considered in examinations of e-publishing deliberations.},

  abstract = {When F1-onset frequency is lower, longer F1 cut-back (VOT) is required for human listeners to perceive synthesized stop consonants as voiceless. K. R. Kluender [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 90, 83-96 (1991)] found comparable effects of F1-onset frequency on the "labeling" of stop consonants by Japanese quail (coturnix coturnix japonica) trained to distinguish stop consonants varying in F1 cut-back. In that study, CVs were synthesized with natural-like rising F1 transitions, and endpoint training stimuli differed in the onset frequency of F1 because a longer cut-back resulted in a higher F1 onset. In order to assess whether earlier results were due to auditory predispositions or due to animals having learned the natural covariance between F1 cut-back and F1-onset frequency, the present experiment was conducted with synthetic continua having either a relatively low (375 Hz) or high (750 Hz) constant-frequency F1. Six birds were trained to respond differentially to endpoint stimuli from three series of synthesized /CV/s varying in duration of F1 cut-back. Second and third formant transitions were appropriate for labial, alveolar, or velar stops. Despite the fact that there was no opportunity for animal subjects to use experienced covariation of F1-onset frequency and F1 cut-back, quail typically exhibited shorter labeling boundaries (more voiceless stops) for intermediate stimuli of the continua when F1 frequency was higher. Responses by human subjects listening to the same stimuli were also collected. Results lend support to the earlier conclusion that part or all of the effect of F1 onset frequency on perception of voicing may be adequately explained by general auditory processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The former is generally easier and examples are more abundant. Because demonstrating homology requires deeper explication of underlying mechanisms, claims can be more precarious but carry potentially greater explanatory payoff. When studying nonhuman organisms as an analogy, the emphasis is typically upon how animal physiological or behavioral processes have adapted to fulfill requirements of particular ecological niches. By contrast, study of animals as homology often violates ecology in search of common underlying processes, and the animal becomes a method more than an object of study. Examples of findings for animal analogies and homologies will be reviewed. Data will be presented from experiments in which nonhuman subjects play the role of homology in revealing both foundational sensory processes and more plastic processes of perceptual development.

Here, we illustrate how efficient coding provides a powerful explanatory framework for understanding speech perception. This framework dissolves debates about objects of perception, instead focusing on the objective of perception: optimizing information transmis-sion between the environment and perceivers. A simple measure of physiologically significant information is shown to predict intelligibility of variable-rate speech and discriminability of vowel sounds. Reliable covariance between acoustic attributes in complex sounds, both speech and nonspeech, is demonstrated to be amply available in natural sounds and efficiently coded by listeners. An efficient coding framework provides a productive approach to answer questions concerning perception of vowel sounds (including vowel inherent spectral change), perception of speech, and perception most broadly.},

  abstract = {The tactile surface forms a continuous sheet covering the body. And yet, the perceived distance between two touches varies across stimulation sites. Perceived tactile distance is larger when stimuli cross over the wrist, compared to when both fall on either the hand or the forearm. This effect could reflect a categorical distortion of tactile space across body-part boundaries (in which stimuli crossing the wrist boundary are perceptually elongated) or may simply reflect a localised increased in acuity surrounding anatomical landmarks (in which stimuli near the wrist are perceptually elongated). We tested these two interpretations across two experiments, by comparing a well-documented bias to perceive mediolateral tactile distances across the forearm/hand as larger than proximodistal ones along the forearm/hand at three different sites (hand, wrist, and forearm). According to the `categorical' interpretation, tactile distances should be elongated selectively in the proximodistal axis thus reducing the anisotropy. According to the `localised acuity' interpretation, distances will be perceptually elongated in the vicinity of the wrist regardless of orientation, leading to increased overall size without affecting anisotropy. Consistent with the categorical account, we found a reduction in the magnitude of anisotropy at the wrist, with no evidence of a corresponding localised increase in precision. These findings demonstrate that we reference touch to a representation of the body that is categorically segmented into discrete parts, which consequently influences the perception of tactile distance.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews are a comprehensive and parameterised form of literature review, found in most disciplines, that involve exhaustive analyses and rigorous interpretation of prior literature. Performing systematic reviews, however, can involve repetitive and laborious work in order to reach reliable standards. Strict guidelines and availability of published reviews make the task amenable to computerised assistance and automation using text mining, information extraction, and machine learning techniques. However, it is unclear which aspects of this Work Task are best suited for such support. This paper describes a three-month ethnographic study and CognitiveWork Analysis of the systematic reviews performed by a medical research group. Our findings show that the IR aspects of systematic reviews involve many tasks at two separate levels: 1) taxonomic organisation of documents and sub-document elements in relation to topic queries and domain-specific resources, and 2) extraction methods for structured summaries from the classified resources. This provides the basis for future work designing search tools with localised optimization and subtask automation to support specific phases of the process.},

Here, resources are typically pooled via common e-infrastructures for data access and processing, a set-up requiring additional layers of coordination. Such a focus largely foregrounds the sciences and other fields that rely on highly structured (or structure-able) data and the routinized processes of analysis. In contrast, in this one-day workshop we discuss the conditions and challenges characteristic of research collaboration in the qualitative social sciences and humanities (SSH). In particular, we examine the sociotechnical infrastructures that enable and support research practices that--in comparison with the collaborative paradigm of the natural sciences--tend to be less structured, compartmentalized, and routinized, but more fluid, flexible, and open-ended. The workshop seeks to collect empirical insights and design experiences, preparing the grounds for a comprehensive understanding of the role of e-infrastructures for collaborative research practices in SSH.},

While the first two types of attributes are also encountered in web-search advertising, the third one fundamentally differentiates native from web-search advertising, and it is the one we model and study in this paper. Evidence from online platforms suggests that the main attributes of the third type that affect ad clicks are the relevance of ads to preceding posts, and the distance between consecutively projected ads; e.g., the fewer the intervening posts between ads, the smaller the click probability is, due to user saturation.},

This paper reviews asymmetries in vowel perception, speaker voice recognition, and speaker normalization in non-human animals \textendash{} topics that have not been thoroughly discussed in relation to the abilities of non-human animals, but are nonetheless important aspects of vocal perception. Throughout this paper we demonstrate that addressing these issues in non-human animals is relevant and worthwhile because many non-human animals must deal with similar issues in their natural environment. That is, they must also discriminate between similar-sounding vocalizations, determine signaler identity from vocalizations, and resolve signaler-dependent variation in vocalizations from conspecifics. Overall, we find that, although plausible, the current evidence is insufficiently strong to conclude that directional asymmetries in vowel perception are specific to humans, or that non-human animals can use voice characteristics to recognize human individuals. However, we do find some indication that non-human animals can normalize speaker differences. Accordingly, we identify avenues for future research that would greatly improve and advance our understanding of these topics.},

  abstract = {In an attempt to clearly differentiate perceptual effects that are attributable to ''auditory'' and ''phonetic'' levels of processing in speech perception we have undertaken a series of experiments with animal listeners. Four chinchillas (Chinchilla laniger) were trained to respond differently to the ''endpoints'' of a synthetic alveolar speech continuum (0 ms VOT and +80 ms VOT) and were then tested in a generalization paradigm with the VOT stimuli between these endpoints. The resulting identification functions were nearly identical to those obtained with adult English-speaking listeners. To test the generality of this agreement, the animals were then tested with synthetic stimuli that had labial and velar places of articulation. As a whole, the functions produced by the two species were very similar; the same relative locations of the phonetic boundaries, with lowest VOT boundaries for labial stimuli and highest for velar stimuli, were obtained for each animal and human subject. No significant differences between species on the absolute values of the phonetic boundaries were obtained, but chinchillas produced identification functions that were slightly, but significantly, less steep. These results are discussed with regard to theories of speech perception, the evolution of a speech-sound repertoire, and current interpretations of the human infant's perceptual proclivities with regard to speech-sound perception.},

The acoustic feature that was varied along the two-formant 15-step continuum was the starting frequency of the second-formant transition. Discrimination of stimulus pairs separated by two steps was tested along the entire continuum in a same-different task. Results demonstrated that peaks in the discrimination functions occur for macaques at the "phonetic boundaries" which separate the /b-d/ and /d-g/ categories for human listeners. The data support two conclusions. First, although current theoretical accounts of place perception by human adults suggest that isolated second-formant transitions are "secondary" cues, learned by association with primary cues, the animal data are more compatible with the notion that second-formant transitions are sufficient to allow the appropriate partitioning of a place continuum in the absence of associative pairing with other more complex cues. Second, we discuss two potential roles played by audition in the evolution of the acoustics of language. One is that audition provided a set of "natural psychophysical boundaries," based on rather simple acoustic properties, which guided the selection of the phonetic repertoire but did not solely determine it; the other is that audition provided a set of rules for the formation of "natural classes" of sound and that phonetic units met those criteria. The data provided in this experiment provide support for the former. Experiments that could more clearly differentiate the two hypotheses are described.},

Noninvasive, safe functional brain measurements have now been proven feasible for use with children starting at birth. The phonetic level of language is especially accessible to experimental studies that document the innate state and the effect of learning on the brain. The neural signatures of learning at the phonetic level can be documented at a remarkably early point in development. Continuity in linguistic development from infants' earliest brain responses to phonetic stimuli is reflected in their language and prereading abilities in the second, third, and fifth year of life, a finding with theoretical and clinical impact. There is evidence that early mastery of the phonetic units of language requires learning in a social context.

  abstract = {Infants learn their native language quickly and effortlessly, and follow the same developmental path regardless of culture. However, it has proved difficult to understand how they do this, or to build computers that can reproduce this feat.An early and essential task for infants is to make sense of the speech that they hear. Each language uses a unique set of about 40 phonemes, and infants must learn to partition varied speech sounds into these phonemic categories. Young infants are sensitive to subtle differences between all phonetic units, whereas older children lose their sensitivity to distinctions that are not used in their native language. The loss of discrimination for foreign-language distinctions is paralleled by an increase in sensitivity to native-language phonetic units.There is evidence that infants analyse the statistical distributions of sounds that they hear in ambient language, and use this information to form phonemic categories. They also learn phonotactic rules \textemdash{} language-specific rules that govern the sequences of phonemes that can be used to compose words.To identify word boundaries, infants can use both transitional probabilities between syllables, and prosodic cues, which relate to linguistic stress. Most languages are dominated by either trochaic words (with the stress on the first syllable) or iambic ones (with the stress on later syllables). Infants seem to use a combination of statistical and prosodic cues to segment words in speech.Social influences are important in speech learning. Infants learn more easily from interactions with human beings speaking another language than they do from audiovisual exposure to the same language material, and their speech is strongly influenced by the response of others around them, such as their mothers. The importance of social input in language learning has some similarities to social influences on song learning in birds.Language experience causes neural changes. One hypothesis, native language neural commitment (NLNC), proposes that language learning produces dedicated neural networks that code the patterns of native-language speech. As these networks develop, they make it easier for new speech elements and patterns to be learned if they are consistent with the existing patterns, but place constraints on the learning of foreign-language patterns. NLNC might explain the closing of the 'sensitive period' for language learning; once a certain amount of learning has occurred, neural commitment interferes with the learning of new languages so they cannot be learned as easily.},

Not only does non-native speech perception decline, as often shown, but native language speech perception skills show improvement, reflecting a facilitative effect of experience with native language. The mechanism underlying change at this point in development, and the relationship between the change in native and non-native speech perception, is of theoretical interest. As shown in new data presented here, at the cusp of this developmental change, infants' native and non-native phonetic perception skills predict later language ability, but in opposite directions. Better native language skill at 7.5 months of age predicts faster language advancement, whereas better non-native language skill predicts slower advancement. We suggest that native language phonetic performance is indicative of neural commitment to the native language, while non-native phonetic performance reveals uncommitted neural circuitry. This paper has three goals: (i) to review existing models of phonetic perception development, (ii) to present new event-related potential data showing that native and non-native phonetic perception at 7.5 months of age predicts language growth over the next 2 years, and (iii) to describe a revised version of our previous model, the native language magnet model, expanded (NLM-e). NLM-e incorporates five new principles. Specific testable predictions for future research programmes are described.},

Theorists have taken this to mean that species-specific mechanisms evolved in animals that aid in the detection and recognition of important stimuli. Similar arguments have been made about the mechanisms that underlie the perception of speech in humans. Theories of speech perception present convincing arguments that even the phonetic level of language requires specially evolved mechanisms, because of the extreme complexity involved in the mapping between sound and percept. Phenomena such as categorical perception have been attributed to the workings of these mechanisms. This paper lays out an argument concerning the contribution of animal studies on categorical perception to the special-mechanisms debate. Animals provide a model of auditory-level processing in the absence of phonetic-level processing, and test whether the existence of a phenomenon such as categorical perception necessitates specialized mechanisms. A review of the studies shows that animal demonstrate categorical perception of the voicing and place features. These data, as well as some recent findings on young human infants, are considered with regard to their impact on theories of infant speech perception and on the evolution of speech.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The genome sequencing revolution is approaching a landmark figure of 1000 completely sequenced genomes. Coupled with fast-declining, per-base sequencing costs, this influx of DNA sequence data has encouraged laboratory scientists to engage large datasets in comparative sequence analyses for making evolutionary, functional and translational inferences. However, the majority of the scientists at the forefront of experimental research are not bioinformaticians, so a gap exists between the user-friendly software needed and the scripting/programming infrastructure often employed for the analysis of large numbers of genes, long genomic segments and groups of sequences. We see an urgent need for the expansion of the fundamental paradigms under which biologist-friendly software tools are designed and developed to fulfill the needs of biologists to analyze large datasets by using sophisticated computational methods. We argue that the design principles need to be sensitive to the reality that comparatively small teams of biologists have historically developed some of the most popular biological software packages in molecular evolutionary analysis. Furthermore, biological intuitiveness and investigator empowerment need to take precedence over the current supposition that biologists should re-tool and become programmers when analyzing genome scale datasets.Contact:s.kumar@asu.edu},

In the International Brain laboratory (IBL), ten experimental labs spanning 7 geographically distributed sites measure neural activity across the brains of mice making perceptual decisions. Here, we report a novel, modular architecture that allows users to contribute, access, and analyze data across this collaboration. Users contribute data using a web-based electronic lab notebook (Alyx), which automatically registers recorded data files and uploads them to a central server. Users access data with a lightweight interface, the Open Neurophysiology Environment (ONE), which searches data from all labs and loads it into MATLAB or Python. To analyze data, we have developed pipelines based on DataJoint, which automatically populate a website displaying a graphical summary of results to date. This architecture provides a new framework to contribute, access and analyze data, surmounting many challenges currently faced by neuroscientists.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Some of the psychological abilities that underlie human speech are shared with other species. One hallmark of speech is that linguistic context affects both how speech sounds are categorized into phonemes, and how different versions of phonemes are produced. We here confirm earlier findings that swamp sparrows categorically perceive the notes that constitute their learned songs and then investigate how categorical boundaries differ according to context. We clustered notes according to their acoustic structure, and found statistical evidence for clustering into 10 population-wide note types. Examining how three related types were perceived, we found, in both discrimination and labeling tests, that an "intermediate" note type is categorized with a "short" type when it occurs at the beginning of a song syllable, but with a "long" type at the end of a syllable. In sum, three produced note-type clusters appear to be underlain by two perceived categories. Thus, in birdsong, as in human speech, categorical perception is context-dependent, and as is the case for human phonology, there is a complex relationship between underlying categorical representations and surface forms. Our results therefore suggest that complex phonology can evolve even in the absence of rich linguistic components, like syntax and semantics.},

In the spirit of addressing this issue, this thesis attempts to shed light on the historical, political, and technical context of TCP/IP. TCP/IP is the Internet Protocol Suite, a primary piece of Internet architecture with a well-documented history. After at technical overview, detailing the main function of TCP/IP, I examine aspects of the social and developmental record of this technology using STS theoretical approaches such as Hughesian systems theory, Social Construction of Technology (SCOT), and Langdon Winner's brand of technological determinism. Key points in TCP/IP evolution, when viewed from an STS perspective, illuminate the varied reasons behind decisions and development of the technology. For example, as detailed in this paper, both technical and political motivations were behind the architectural politics built into TCP/IP in the 1970s, and similar motivations spurred the rejection of OSI protocols by Internet developers two decades later. Armed with resultant contextual understanding of previous TCP/IP developments, a few possible directions (both political and technical) in contemporary and future Internet development are then explored, such as the slow migration to IPv6 and the meaning of network neutrality.},

However, many of these "grand challenges" in computational biology, such as simulating how proteins fold, remained unsolved due to their great complexity. Indeed, even to simulate the fastest folding protein would require decades on the fastest modern CPUs. Here, we review novel methods to fundamentally speed such previously intractable problems using a new computational paradigm: distributed computing. By efficiently harnessing tens of thousands of computers throughout the world, we have been able to break previous computational barriers. However, distributed computing brings new challenges, such as how to efficiently divide a complex calculation of many PCs that are connected by relatively slow networking. Moreover, even if the challenge of accurately reproducing reality can be conquered, a new challenge emerges: how can we take the results of these simulations (typically tens to hundreds of gigabytes of raw data) and gain some insight into the questions at hand. This challenge of the analysis of the sea of data resulting from large-scale simulation will likely remain for decades to come.},

When humans categorize multidimensional stimuli on the basis of a single dimension this has been taken to indicate use of a rule that could be verbalized. Sorting on the basis of all the stimulus dimensions (`overall similarity' or `family resemblance') has been taken to indicate a more basic, implicit, automatic, perhaps associative process. However, a review of the literature on animal discrimination learning shows that animals often discriminate on the basis of one dominant dimension. In recent experiments, situations conducive to more complex cognitive processes have increased family resemblance sorting in humans. In an effort to resolve this apparent paradox, experiments were conducted in which humans and pigeons were exposed to multidimensional category discrimination tasks under closely similar conditions. Preliminary results show no evidence that even a non-verbal rule can be said to be involved in pigeons' choices in these conditions, despite the fact that under some conditions a single dimension may dominate their behavior.},

Some stimulus domains are better suited to featural representation, characterizing stimuli in terms of the presence or absence of discrete features, rather than as points in a multidimensional space. We report on empirical data measuring human categorization performance across a featural stimulus domain and show that ALCOVE is unable to capture fundamental qualitative aspects of this performance. In response, a featural version of the ALCOVE model is developed, replacing the spatial stimulus representations that are usually generated by multidimensional scaling with featural representations generated by additive clustering. We demonstrate that this featural version of ALCOVE is able to capture human performance where the spatial model failed, explaining the difference in terms of the contrasting representational assumptions made by the two approaches. Finally, we discuss ways in which the ALCOVE categorization model might be extended further to use ``hybrid'' representational structures combining spatial and featural components.},

Infrastructure building projects for science are complex forms of collaborative work that involve many subgroups. As part of an ongoing research project, we use ethnographic methods to explore the roles, categories, and relationships that are sometimes taken for granted in cyberinfrastructure research and development.

Here, we compare the structure, function, and development of each auditory cortex (ACx) in the mouse to look for specializations that may underlie lateralization. Using Fos brain volume imaging, we found greater activation in the left ACx in response to vocalizations, while the right ACx responded more to frequency sweeps. In vivo recordings identified hemispheric differences in spectrotemporal selectivity, reinforcing their functional differences. We then compared the synaptic connectivity within each hemisphere and discovered lateralized circuit-motifs that are hearing experience-dependent. Our results suggest a specialist role for the left ACx, focused on facilitating the detection of specific vocalization features, while the right ACx is a generalist with the ability to integrate spectrotemporal features more broadly.},

  abstract = {Listeners must accomplish two complementary perceptual feats in extracting a message from speech. They must discriminate linguistically-relevant acoustic variability and generalize across irrelevant variability. Said another way, they must categorize speech. Since the mapping of acoustic variability is language-specific, these categories must be learned from experience. Thus, understanding how, in general, the auditory system acquires and represents categories can inform us about the toolbox of mechanisms available to speech perception. This perspective invites consideration of findings from cognitive neuroscience literatures outside of the speech domain as a means of constraining models of speech perception. Although neurobiological models of speech perception have mainly focused on cerebral cortex, research outside the speech domain is consistent with the possibility of significant subcortical contributions in category learning. Here, we review the functional role of one such structure, the basal ganglia. We examine research from animal electrophysiology, human neuroimaging, and behavior to consider characteristics of basal ganglia processing that may be advantageous for speech category learning. We also present emerging evidence for a direct role for basal ganglia in learning auditory categories in a complex, naturalistic task intended to model the incidental manner in which speech categories are acquired. To conclude, we highlight new research questions that arise in incorporating the broader neuroscience research literature in modeling speech perception, and suggest how understanding contributions of the basal ganglia can inform attempts to optimize training protocols for learning non-native speech categories in adulthood.},

  abstract = {Listeners must accomplish two complementary perceptual feats in extracting a message from speech. They must discriminate linguistically-relevant acoustic variability and generalize across irrelevant variability. Said another way, they must categorize speech. Since the mapping of acoustic variability is language-specific, these categories must be learned from experience. Thus, understanding how, in general, the auditory system acquires and represents categories can inform us about the toolbox of mechanisms available to speech perception. This perspective invites consideration of findings from cognitive neuroscience literatures outside of the speech domain as a means of constraining models of speech perception. Although neurobiological models of speech perception have mainly focused on cerebral cortex, research outside the speech domain is consistent with the possibility of significant subcortical contributions in category learning. Here, we review the functional role of one such structure, the basal ganglia. We examine research from animal electrophysiology, human neuroimaging, and behavior to consider characteristics of basal ganglia processing that may be advantageous for speech category learning. We also present emerging evidence for a direct role for basal ganglia in learning auditory categories in a complex, naturalistic task intended to model the incidental manner in which speech categories are acquired. To conclude, we highlight new research questions that arise in incorporating the broader neuroscience research literature in modeling speech perception, and suggest how understanding contributions of the basal ganglia can inform attempts to optimize training protocols for learning non-native speech categories in adulthood.},

The common thread was examining coarticulatory dynamics through the prism of locus equations (LEs). Multiple experimental methodologies (articulatory synthesis, X-ray film, Principal Component Analysis, and extraction of time constants for F2 transitions), guided by a few theoretical assumptions about speech motor planning and control, were used to uncover the articulatory underpinnings responsible for the trademark acoustic form of LE scatterplots. Specific findings were: (1) the concept of a stop consonantal 'target' was quantitatively derived as a vowel-neutral, 'deactivated,' tongue contour; (2) the linearity of LEs is significantly enhanced by the uniformity of F2 transition time constants, which normalize with respect to F2 transition extents, and an inherent linear bias created by the smaller frequency range of [F2 onset-F2 vowel] relative to F2 vowel frequencies; (3) realistic LE slopes and y-intercepts were derived by modeling different extents of V 2 overlap onto stop consonantal target shapes at closure; and (4) a conceptually simple model, viz. interpolation between successive articulatory target shapes, followed by derivation of their formant values expressed as LEs, came surprisingly close to matching actual LEs obtained from our speaker. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Previous studies have identified two tonotopic auditory areas in the mouse\textemdash primary auditory cortex (AI) and anterior auditory field (AAF)\textemdash{} but auditory receptive fields in these areas have not yet been described. To establish a foundation for investigating auditory cortical circuitry and plasticity in the mouse, we characterized receptive-field structure in AI and AAF of anesthetized mice using spectrally complex and temporally dynamic stimuli as well as simple tonal stimuli. Spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) were derived from extracellularly recorded responses to complex stimuli, and frequency-intensity tuning curves were constructed from responses to simple tonal stimuli. Both analyses revealed temporal differences between AI and AAF responses: peak latencies and receptive-field durations for STRFs and first-spike latencies for responses to tone bursts were significantly longer in AI than in AAF. Spectral properties of AI and AAF receptive fields were more similar, although STRF bandwidths were slightly broader in AI than in AAF. Finally, in both AI and AAF, a substantial minority of STRFs were spectrotemporally inseparable. The spectrotemporal interaction typically appeared in the form of clearly disjoint excitatory and inhibitory subfields or an obvious spectrotemporal slant in the STRF. These data provide the first detailed description of auditory receptive fields in the mouse and suggest that although neurons in areas AI and AAF share many response characteristics, area AAF may be specialized for faster temporal processing.},

Initially, the two categories differ in the timingof vocal fold adduction and onset of fold vibration, andseveral acoustic cues, all tied to the VOT difference, havebeen studied. Medially there is also a difference in themanagement of the larynx, though it results in a phoneticallysimpler contrast, one of voicing with no accompanying aspiration difference.Acoustically, however, the list of features that play, or mightplausibly play a role is quite large. The word pairrapid-rabid, for example, might be affected by the following: (1)presence/absence of low-frequency buzz during the closure interval, (2) durationof closure, (3) F1 offset frequency before closure, (4) F1offset transition duration, (5) F1 onset frequency following closure, (6)F1 onset transition duration, (7) \ae{} duration, (8) F1 cut-backbefore closure, (9) F1 cutback following closure, (10) VOT cutbackbefore closure, (11) VOT delay after closure, (12) F0 contourbefore closure, (13) F0 contour after closure, (14) amplitude ofi relative to \ae, (15) decay time of glottal signalpreceding closure, (16) intensity of burst following closure.

  abstract = {Database systems were a solution to the problem of shared access to heterogeneous files created by multiple autonomous applications in a centralized environment. To make data usage easier, the files were replaced by a globally integrated database. To a large extent, the idea was successful, and many databases are now accessible through local and long-haul networks. Unavoidably, users now need shared access to multiple autonomous databases. The question is what the corresponding methodology should be. Should one reapply the database approach to create globally integrated distributed database systems or should a new approach be introduced? We argue for a new approach to solving such data management system problems, called multidatabase or federated systems. These systems make databases interoperable, that is, usable without a globally integrated schema. They preserve the autonomy of each database yet support shared access. Systems of this type will be of major importance in the future. This paper first discusses why this is the case. Then, it presents methodologies for their design. It further shows that major commerical relational database systems are evolving toward multidatabase systems. The paper discusses their capabilities and limitations, presents and discusses a set of prototypes, and, finally, presents some current research issues.},

A necessary function of auditory perception is to generalize across the high variability inherent in vocalization production and classify them into behaviorally distinct categories (`words' or `call types'). Here, we demonstrate that detecting mid-level features in calls achieves production-invariant classification. Starting from randomly chosen marmoset call features, we use a greedy search algorithm to determine the most informative and least redundant features necessary for call classification. High classification performance is achieved using only 10\textendash 20 features per call type. Predictions of tuning properties of putative feature-selective neurons accurately match some observed auditory cortical responses. This feature-based approach also succeeds for call categorization in other species, and for other complex classification tasks such as caller identification. Our results suggest that high-level neural representations of sounds are based on task-dependent features optimized for specific computational goals.},

However, the representation of temporal information, e.g., sound offset, is unclear. We perform multiscale imaging of neuronal and thalamic activity evoked by sound onset and offset in awake mouse ACX. ACX areas differed in onset responses (On-Rs) and offset responses (Off-Rs). Most excitatory L2/3 neurons show either On-Rs or Off-Rs, and ACX areas are characterized by differing fractions of On and Off-R neurons. Somatostatin and parvalbumin interneurons show distinct temporal dynamics, potentially amplifying Off-Rs. Functional network analysis shows that ACX areas contain distinct parallel onset and offset networks. Thalamic (MGB) terminals show either On-Rs or Off-Rs, indicating a thalamic origin of On and Off-R pathways. Thus, ACX areas spatially represent temporal features, and this representation is created by spatial~convergence and co-activation of distinct MGB inputs and is refined by specific intracortical connectivity.},

However, designing automated boxes for behavioral studies requires a coordinated combination of mechanical, electronic, and software design skills which can challenge even the best engineers, and for that reason used to be out of reach for the majority of experimental neurobiology and behavioral pharmacology researchers. Due to parallel advances in open-source hardware and software developed for neuroscience researchers, by neuroscience researchers, the landscape has now changed significantly. Here, we discuss powerful approaches to the study of behavior using examples and tutorials in the Bonsai visual programming language, towards designing simple neuroscience experiments that can help researchers immediately get started. This language makes it easy for researchers, even without programming experience, to combine the operation of several open-source devices in parallel and design their own integrated custom solutions, enabling unique and flexible approaches to the study of behavior, including video tracking of behavior and closed-loop electrophysiology.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many sensory neurons encode information about more than one stimulus feature. Multidimensional tuning increases ambiguity in stimulus-response relationships, but we find that it also offers an unexpected computational advantage, allowing the brain to better reconstruct sensory stimuli. From the responses of sensory neurons, populations, and sensory-driven movement behavior, more information can be recovered about a stimulus vector than about its individual components. We term this coding advantage 9stimulus synergy9 and show that it is distinct from other coding synergies, arising from inseparability of the response- conditioned stimulus distribution along individual stimulus dimensions. From extracellular recordings in motion sensitive cortex and measurements of pursuit eye movements, we demonstrate that stimulus synergy in cortical populations is preserved downstream in the precision of pursuit, and that a common decoding model predicts the level of synergy in pursuit behavior. This suggests that the brain exploits the information advantage afforded by multidimensional sensory tuning.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Price, features, and compatibility determine the adoption rate of software. Monopolies tend to form in software because compatibility is often the most important goal of customers. The existence of previous versions of software has disciplined monopolists because customers are unlikely to upgrade unless the new version provides substantially higher value than the one that they own. The service-based model eliminates this important substitute and thus locked-in customers are more likely to continue paying for the product even if its price is higher and its features remain the same. Potential policy alternatives include laws that give customers the option of owning software and the ability to continue using previous versions when purchasing new corporate systems.},

We find that the HSIC bottleneck provides a performance on the MNIST/FashionMNIST/CIFAR10 classification comparable to backpropagation with a cross-entropy target, even when the system is not encouraged to make the output resemble the classification labels.

From World War I cryptography and spying to weapons targeting against Hitler and then Stalin, the monolithic aspect of the digital network was largely determined by its genesis in a single, state-sponsored institution.In the 1960s, internationalism and openness were introduced by the tech pioneers of California's counter-culture, the seed bed for what became Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple. But in the last 15 years, security concerns of states and the privatizing impetus of e-commerce have come to the fore and momentum has shifted in a new direction, towards private, walled domains, each vying with the other in an increasingly fragmented system, in effect a ``Splinternet.''Because the Internet today surrounds us so comprehensively, it's easy to regard the way it functions as a simple given, part of the natural order of things. Only by stepping back and scrutinizing the evolution of the system can we see the Internet for what it is\textemdash a contested, protean terrain, constantly evolving as different forces intervene to drive it forward.

The book uses explanation, discussion and practice to make explicit the forms of knowledge of language and of translation that makes translators successful. Chapters on the development of translation studies in the west and on contemporary approaches to translation provide the disciplinary context within which the processes and products of translating are studied. The theoretical and academic context for the chapters in which application is focal is provided by the book's flexible and forward-looking approach to meaning and translation. Meaning is seen as a temporary relationship between participants in language events and translation as a creative activity that contributes to such events. From this position, interaction between language study, linguistics and translation studies is seen as mutually enriching. Five practical chapters cover sounds and rhythms, lexis, collocation and semantic prosody, texture, register, cohesion, coherence, implicature, speech and text acts, text and genre analysis, clausal thematicity and transitivity and the expression through language choices of ideological positions. Key Features Each chapter provides examples for analysis and translating practice based on a variety of text types, including poems, prose, drama, newspaper and journal articles, promotional materials and texts for tourists. Examples are drawn mainly from Danish, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish, but most practice sections can be used for analysis and translation into any language from English The book can be used at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

  abstract = {Song learning shapes the response properties of auditory neurons in the song system to become highly selective for the individual bird's own ("autogenous") song. The auditory representation of autogenous song is achieved in part by neurons that exhibit facilitated responses to combinations of components of song. To understand the circuits that underlie these complex properties, the combination sensitivity of single units in the hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudale (HVc) of urethane-anesthetized zebra finches was studied. Some neurons exhibited nonlinear temporal summation, spectral summation, or both. The majority of these neurons exhibited low spontaneous rates and phasic responses. Most combination-sensitive neurons required highly accurate copies of sounds derived from the autogenous song and responded weakly to tone bursts, combinations of simple stimuli, or conspecific songs. Temporal combination-sensitive (TCS) neurons required either two or more segments of a single syllable, or two or more syllables of the autogenous song, to elicit a facilitated, excitatory response. TCS neurons integrated auditory input over periods ranging from 80 to 350 msec, although this represents a lower limit. Harmonic combination-sensitive (HCS) neurons required combinations of two harmonics with particular frequency and temporal characteristics that were similar to autogenous song syllables. Both TCS and HCS neurons responded much more weakly when the dynamical spectral features of the autogenous song or syllables were modified than when the dynamical amplitude (waveform) features of the songs were modified. These results suggest that understanding the temporal dynamics of auditory responses in HVc may provide insight into neuronal circuits modified by song learning.},

  abstract = {Recurrent networks of non-linear units display a variety of dynamical regimes depending on the structure of their synaptic connectivity. A particularly remarkable phenomenon is the appearance of strongly fluctuating, chaotic activity in networks of deterministic, but randomly connected rate units. How this type of intrinsically generated fluctuations appears in more realistic networks of spiking neurons has been a long standing question. To ease the comparison between rate and spiking networks, recent works investigated the dynamical regimes of randomly-connected rate networks with segregated excitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing rates constrained to be positive. These works derived general dynamical mean field (DMF) equations describing the fluctuating dynamics, but solved these equations only in the case of purely inhibitory networks. Using a simplified excitatory-inhibitory architecture in which DMF equations are more easily tractable, here we show that the presence of excitation qualitatively modifies the fluctuating activity compared to purely inhibitory networks. In presence of excitation, intrinsically generated fluctuations induce a strong increase in mean firing rates, a phenomenon that is much weaker in purely inhibitory networks. Excitation moreover induces two different fluctuating regimes: for moderate overall coupling, recurrent inhibition is sufficient to stabilize fluctuations; for strong coupling, firing rates are stabilized solely by the upper bound imposed on activity, even if inhibition is stronger than excitation. These results extend to more general network architectures, and to rate networks receiving noisy inputs mimicking spiking activity.

  abstract = {Large-scale neural recordings have established that the transformation of sensory stimuli into motor outputs relies on low-dimensional dynamics at the population level, while individual neurons exhibit complex selectivity. Understanding how low-dimensional computations on mixed, distributed representations emerge from the structure of the recurrent connectivity and inputs to cortical networks is a major challenge. Here, we study a class of recurrent network models in which the connectivity is a sum of a random part and a minimal, low-dimensional structure. We show that, in such networks, the dynamics are low dimensional and can be directly inferred from connectivity using a geometrical approach. We exploit this understanding to determine minimal connectivity required to implement specific computations and find that the dynamical range and computational capacity quickly increase with the dimensionality of the connectivity structure. This framework produces testable experimental predictions for the relationship between connectivity, low-dimensional dynamics, and computational features of recorded neurons.},

  abstract = {Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience. Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies, humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with computer-based tracking, but markers are intrusive, and the number and location of the markers must be determined a priori. Here we present an efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors. Remarkably, even when only a small number of frames are labeled (\textasciitilde 200), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.},

Even though intrinsic subject matter difficulties (20 are listed) contribute to this, the excessive reliance on significance testing is partly responsible (Ronald A. Fisher). Karl Popper's approach, with modifications, would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of "significant differences" are little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions. Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values ("consistency tests") are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, 2nd-order differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94\% success with no false negatives.

Flankers varied in contrast, orientation, angular position, and sign. Rats are impaired at detecting visual targets with collinear flankers, compared to configurations where flankers differ from the target in orientation or angular position. In particular, rats are more likely to miss the target when flankers are collinear. The same impairment is found even when the flanker luminance was sign-reversed relative to the target. These findings suggest that contour alignment alters visual processing in rats, despite their lack of orientation columns in the visual cortex. This is the first report that the arrangement of visual features relative to each other affects visual behavior in rats. To provide a conceptual framework for our findings, we relate our stimuli to a contrast normalization model of early visual processing. We suggest a pattern-sensitive generalization of the model that could account for a collinear deficit. These experiments were performed using a novel method for automated high-throughput training and testing of visual behavior in rodents.},

The superior temporal gyrus (STG) participates in high-order auditory processing of speech, but how it encodes phonetic information is poorly understood.

At single electrodes, we found response selectivity to distinct phonetic features. Encoding of acoustic properties was mediated by a distributed population response. Phonetic features could be directly related to tuning for spectrotemporal acoustic cues, some of which were encoded in a nonlinear fashion or by integration of multiple cues.

  abstract = {Humans and animals can reliably perceive behaviorally relevant sounds in noisy and reverberant environments, yet the neural mechanisms behind this phenomenon are largely unknown. To understand how neural circuits represent degraded auditory stimuli with additive and reverberant distortions, we compared single-neuron responses in ferret primary auditory cortex to speech and vocalizations in four conditions: clean, additive white and pink (1/f) noise, and reverberation. Despite substantial distortion, responses of neurons to the vocalization signal remained stable, maintaining the same statistical distribution in all conditions. Stimulus spectrograms reconstructed from population responses to the distorted stimuli resembled more the original clean than the distorted signals. To explore mechanisms contributing to this robustness, we simulated neural responses using several spectrotemporal receptive field models that incorporated either a static nonlinearity or subtractive synaptic depression and multiplicative gain normalization. The static model failed to suppress the distortions. A dynamic model incorporating feed-forward synaptic depression could account for the reduction of additive noise, but only the combined model with feedback gain normalization was able to predict the effects across both additive and reverberant conditions. Thus, both mechanisms can contribute to the abilities of humans and animals to extract relevant sounds in diverse noisy environments.},

In this review, we examine evidence that single cortical neurons receive input covering much of the audible spectrum. We then propose an anatomical framework by which spectral information converges on single neurons in primary auditory cortex, via a combination of thalamocortical and intracortical "horizontal" pathways. By its nature, the framework confers sensitivity to specific, spectrotemporally complex stimuli. Finally, to address how spectral integration can be regulated, we show how one neuromodulator, acetylcholine, could act within the hypothesized framework to alter integration in single neurons. The results of these studies promote a cellular understanding of information processing in auditory cortex.},

In this paper, we present the results of extensive measurements of more than half a million peers in five communities, ranging from highly popular and well-known public communities to elite private communities that can only be joined by invitation. We observe that the performance experienced by downloaders in the private communities is by far superior to the performance in the public communities, and we observe significant differences in connectability, seeder/leecher ratio, and seeding duration. Based on our results, we conjecture that when effective ratio enforcement mechanisms are in place, BitTorrent's tit-for-tat mechanism is hardly influential anymore. Our multi-community, multi-swarm measurements are significantly broader and more extensive than any earlier measurement study on BitTorrent.},

  abstract = {Summary Breakthroughs in understanding the neural basis of natural behavior require neural recording and intervention to be paired with high-fidelity multimodal behavioral monitoring. An extensive genetic toolkit for neural circuit dissection, and well-developed neural recording technology, make the mouse a powerful model organism for systems neuroscience. However, most methods for high-bandwidth acquisition of behavioral data in mice rely upon fixed-position cameras and other off-animal devices, complicating the monitoring of animals freely engaged in natural behaviors. Here, we report the development of a lightweight head-mounted camera system combined with head-movement sensors to simultaneously monitor eye position, pupil dilation, whisking, and~pinna movements along with head motion in unrestrained, freely behaving mice. The power of the combined technology is demonstrated by observations linking eye position to head orientation; whisking to non-tactile stimulation; and, in electrophysiological experiments, visual cortical activity to volitional head movements.},

  abstract = {Recent findings suggest that long-term spatial and contextual memories depend on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. RSC damage impairs navigation in humans and rodents [6, 7, 8], and the RSC is closely interconnected with brain regions known to play a role in navigation, including the hippocampus and anterior thalamus [9, 10]. Navigation-related neural activity is seen in humans [11] and rodents, including spatially localized firing [12, 13], directional firing [12, 14, 15], and responses to navigational cues [16]. RSC neuronal activity is modulated by allocentric, egocentric, and route-centered spatial reference frames [17, 18], consistent with an RSC role in integrating different kinds of navigational information [19]. However, the relationship between RSC firing patterns and spatial memory remains largely unexplored, as previous physiology studies have not employed behavioral tasks with a clear memory demand. To address this, we trained rats on a continuous T-maze alternation task and examined RSC firing patterns throughout learning. We found that the RSC developed a distributed population-level representation of the rat's spatial location and current trajectory to the goal as the rats learned. After the rats reached peak performance, RSC firing patterns began to represent the upcoming goal location as the rats approached the choice point. These neural simulations of the goal emerged at the same time that lesions impaired alternation performance, suggesting that the RSC gradually acquired task representations that contribute to navigational decision-making.},

The 13 "speech" stimuli in this set varied in the initial stationary frequency of the third formant (F3) and its subsequent transition into the vowel over a range sufficient to produce the perception of [1' a) and [I a) for American subjects and to produce [1' a) (which is not in phonemic contrast to [I a)) for Japanese subjects. Discrimination tests of a comparable set of stimuli consisting of the isolated F3 components provided a "nonspeech" control. For Americans, the discrimination of the speech stimuli was nearly categorical, i.e., comparison pairs which were identified as different phonemes were discriminated with high accuracy, while pairs which were identified as the same phoneme were discriminated relatively poorly. In comparison, discrimination of speech stimuli by Japanese subjects was only slightly better than chance for all comparison pairs. Performance on nonspeech stimuli, however, was virtually identical for Japanese and American subjects; both groups showed highly accurate discrimination of all comparison pairs. These results suggest that the effect of linguistic experience is specific to perception in the "speech mode." One way to examine the effect of linguistic experience on the perception of speech is to compare the discrimination of phonetic segments by two groups of speakers: one group speaks a language in},

Here, we combined chronic in vivo two-photon imaging of dendritic spines with auditory-cued classical conditioning to test if the formation of a fear memory is associated with structural changes of synapses in the mouse auditory cortex. We find that paired conditioning and unpaired conditioning induce a transient increase in spine formation or spine elimination, respectively. A fraction of spines formed during paired conditioning persists and leaves a long-lasting trace in the network. Memory recall triggered by the reexposure of mice to the sound cue did not lead to changes in spine dynamics. Our findings provide a synaptic mechanism for plasticity in sound responses of auditory cortex neurons induced by auditory-cued fear conditioning; they also show that retrieval of an auditory fear memory does not lead to a recapitulation of structural plasticity in the auditory cortex as observed during initial memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Using ultra-high field fMRI, we explored the cortical depth-dependent stability of acoustic feature preference in human auditory cortex. We collected responses from human auditory cortex (subjects from either sex) to a large number of natural sounds at submillimeter spatial resolution, and observed that these responses were well explained by a model that assumes neuronal population tuning to frequency-specific spectrotemporal modulations. We observed a relatively stable (columnar) tuning to frequency and temporal modulations. However, spectral modulation tuning was variable throughout the cortical depth. This difference in columnar stability between feature maps could not be explained by a difference in map smoothness, as the preference along the cortical sheet varied in a similar manner for the different feature maps. Furthermore, tuning to all three features was more columnar in primary than nonprimary auditory cortex. The observed overall lack of overlapping columnar regions across acoustic feature maps suggests, especially for primary auditory cortex, a coding strategy in which across cortical depths tuning to some features is kept stable, whereas tuning to other features systematically varies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In the human auditory cortex, sound aspects are processed in large-scale maps. Invasive animal studies show that an additional processing organization may be implemented orthogonal to the cortical sheet (i.e., in the columnar direction), but it is unknown whether observed organizational principles apply to the human auditory cortex. Combining ultra-high field fMRI with natural sounds, we explore the columnar organization of various sound aspects. Our results suggest that the human auditory cortex contains a modular coding strategy, where, for each module, several sound aspects act as an anchor along which computations are performed while the processing of another sound aspect undergoes a transformation. This strategy may serve to optimally represent the content of our complex acoustic natural environment.},

KGs are typically stored in a graph-database format, and graph-database queries can be used to answer questions of interest that have been posed by users such as biomedical researchers. For simple queries, the inclusion of direct connections in the KG and the storage and analysis of query results are straightforward; however, for complex queries, these capabilities become exponentially more challenging with each increase in complexity of the query. For instance, one relatively complex query can yield a KG with hundreds of thousands of query results. Thus, the ability to efficiently query, store, rank and explore sub-graphs of a complex KG represents a major challenge to any effort designed to exploit the use of KGs for applications in biomedical research and other domains. We present Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways as an abstraction layer and user interface to more easily query KGs and store, rank and explore query results.An instance of the ROBOKOP UI for exploration of the ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph can be found at http://robokop.renci.org.

However, since speech sounds differ acoustically from the non-speech sounds, it is possible that this region is not involved in speech perception per se, but rather in processing of some complex acoustic features. "Sine wave speech" (SWS) provides a tool to study neural speech specificity using identical acoustic stimuli, which can be perceived either as speech or non-speech, depending on previous experience of the stimuli. We scanned 21 subjects using 3T functional MRI in two sessions, both including SWS and control stimuli. In the pre-training session, all subjects perceived the SWS stimuli as non-speech. In the post-training session, the identical stimuli were perceived as speech by 16 subjects. In these subjects, SWS stimuli elicited significantly stronger activity within the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (STSp) in the post- vs. pre-training session. In contrast, activity in this region was not enhanced after training in 5 subjects who did not perceive SWS stimuli as speech. Moreover, the control stimuli, which were always perceived as non-speech, elicited similar activity in this region in both sessions. Altogether, the present findings suggest that activation of the neural speech representations in the left STSp might be a pre-requisite for hearing sounds as speech. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Reliably detecting unexpected sounds is important for environmental awareness and survival. By selectively reducing responses to frequently, but not rarely, occurring sounds, auditory cortical neurons are thought to enhance the brain's ability to detect unexpected events through stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). The majority of neurons in the primary auditory cortex exhibit SSA, yet little is known about the underlying cortical circuits. We found that two types of cortical interneurons differentially amplify SSA in putative excitatory neurons. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) amplify SSA by providing non-specific inhibition: optogenetic suppression of PVs led to an equal increase in responses to frequent and rare tones. In contrast, somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOMs) selectively reduce excitatory responses to frequent tones: suppression of SOMs led to an increase in responses to frequent, but not to rare tones. A mutually coupled excitatory-inhibitory network model accounts for distinct mechanisms by which cortical inhibitory neurons enhance the brain's sensitivity to unexpected sounds.},

In the auditory cortex (AC), parvalbumin- (PV) and~somatostatin-positive (SOM) inhibitory interneurons differentially modulate frequency-dependent responses of excitatory neurons. Responsiveness of neurons in the AC to sound is also dependent on stimulus history. We found that the inhibitory effects of SOMs and PVs diverged as a function of adaptation to temporal repetition of tones. Prior to adaptation, suppressing either SOM or PV inhibition drove both increases and decreases in excitatory spiking activity. After adaptation, suppressing SOM activity caused predominantly disinhibitory effects, whereas suppressing PV activity still evoked bi-directional changes. SOM, but not PV-driven inhibition, dynamically modulated frequency tuning with adaptation. Unlike PV-driven inhibition, SOM-driven inhibition elicited gain-like increases in frequency tuning reflective of adaptation. Our findings suggest that distinct cortical interneurons differentially shape tuning to sensory stimuli across the neuronal receptive field, altering frequency selectivity of excitatory neurons during adaptation.},

In this comment, I discuss some of these issues from a scientific perspective. What goal does model selection serve when all models are known to be systematically wrong? How might ``toy problems'' tell a misleading story? How does the scientific goal of explanation align with (or differ from) traditional statistical concerns?

  abstract = {The circuits responsible for social communication are some of the most important and least understood in the brain. Human studies have made great progress in advancing our understanding of the global computations required for processing speech, and animal models offer the opportunity to discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for decoding these signals. In this review we describe some of the most well-established speech decoding computations from human studies and describe animal studies designed to reveal potential circuit mechanisms underlying these processes. Human and animal brains must perform the challenging tasks of rapidly recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds in a noisy environment. The instructions to these functions are found in the precise connections neurons make with one another. Therefore, identifying circuit-motifs in the auditory cortices and linking them to communicative functions is pivotal. We review recent advances in human recordings that have revealed the most basic unit of speech encoded by neurons, and relate these findings to circuit-mapping studies in rodents that have shown potential connectivity schemes to achieve this. Finally, we discuss other putative important processing features in humans like lateralization, sensitivity to fine temporal features, and hierarchical processing. The goal is for animal studies to investigate neurophysiological and anatomical pathways responsible for establishing accessible behavioral phenotypes that are shared between humans and animals. This can be accomplished by establishing cell types, connectivity patterns, genetic pathways and critical periods that are relevant in the development and function of social communication.},

A continuum of shape change between 15 pairs of objects was created and the images along the continuum were used as stimuli. In Experiment 1 participants were first required to discriminate pairs of images of objects that lay along the shape continuum. Then participants were asked to classify each morph-image into one of two pre-specified classes. We found evidence for categorical perception in some but not all of our object pairs. In Experiment 2 we varied the viewpoint of the objects in the discrimination task and found that effects of categorical perception generalized across changes in view. In Experiment 3 similarity ratings for each object pair were collected. These similarity scores correlated with the degree of perceptual categorization found for the object pairs. Our findings suggest that some familiar objects are perceived categorically and that categorical perception is closely tied to inter-object perceptual similarity.},

As an important contribution to this topic, based on their theoretical and empirical comparisons between the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression, Ng and Jordan (NIPS 841-848, 2001) claimed that there exist two distinct regimes of performance between the generative and discriminative classifiers with regard to the training-set size. In this paper, our empirical and simulation studies, as a complement of their work, however, suggest that the existence of the two distinct regimes may not be so reliable. In addition, for real world datasets, so far there is no theoretically correct, general criterion for choosing between the discriminative and the generative approaches to classification of an observation x into a class y; the choice depends on the relative confidence we have in the correctness of the specification of either p(y vertical bar x) or p(x, y) for the data. This can be to some extent a demonstration of why Efron (J Am Stat Assoc 70(352):892-898, 1975) and O'Neill (J Am Stat Assoc 75(369):154-160, 1980) prefer normal-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when no model mis-specification occurs but other empirical studies may prefer linear logistic regression instead. Furthermore, we suggest that pairing of either LDA assuming a common diagonal covariance matrix (LDA-A) or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression may not be perfect, and hence it may not be reliable for any claim that was derived from the comparison between LDA-A or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression to be generalised to all generative and discriminative classifiers.},

We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those~measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice.},

But it is unknown how different regions and hemispheres of human auditory cortex collectively integrate across multiple timescales. To answer this question, we developed a novel method to estimate integration periods and applied this method to intracranial recordings. We show that human auditory cortex integrates across time hierarchically, with three-fold longer integration periods in non-primary vs. primary regions, but no difference between hemispheres. Moreover, we show that selectivity for categories, such as speech and music, is restricted to electrodes with long integration periods. These findings suggest that short-term structure in natural sounds is analyzed by general-purpose acoustic mechanisms in primary auditory cortex, and then integrated over long timescales to form category-specific representations in non-primary regions. Our study thus reveals how the human brain constructs abstract representations of sound by integrating across multiple timescales.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Speech perception involves prediction, but how is that prediction implemented? In cognitive models prediction has often been taken to imply that there is feedback of activation from lexical to pre-lexical processes as implemented in interactive-activation models (IAMs). We show that simple activation feedback does not actually improve speech recognition. However, other forms of feedback can be beneficial. In particular, feedback can enable the listener to adapt to changing input, and can potentially help the listener to recognise unusual input, or recognise speech in the presence of competing sounds. The common feature of these helpful forms of feedback is that they are all ways of optimising the performance of speech recognition using Bayesian inference. That is, listeners make predictions about speech because speech recognition is optimal in the sense captured in Bayesian models.},

(b) Infants and various nonhuman species can differentiate certain sound contrasts in human speech even though it is highly unlikely that they can deduce the vocal tract movements generating the sounds. (c) Humans can differentiate many nonspeech sounds almost as complex as speech, e.g., music, machine noises, as well as bird and monkey vocalizations, where there is little or no possibility of recovering the mechanisms producing the sounds.},

  abstract = {Connectivity determines the function of neural circuits and it is the gateway to behavioral output. The emergent properties of the Auditory Cortex (ACx) have been difficult to unravel partly due to our assumption that it is organized similarly to other sensory areas. But detailed investigations of its functional connectivity have begun to reveal significant differences from other cortical areas that perform different functions. Using Laser Scanning Photostimulation we previously discovered unique circuit features in the ACx. Specifically, we found that the functional asymmetry of the ACx (tonotopy and isofrequency axes) is reflected in the local circuitry of excitatory inputs to Layer 3 pyramidal neurons. In the present study we extend the functional wiring diagram of the ACx with an investigation of the connectivity patterns of inhibitory subclasses. We compared excitatory input to parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons and found distinct circuit-motifs between and within these subpopulations. Moreover, these connectivity motifs emerged as intrinsic differences between the left and right ACx. Our results support a functional circuit based approach to understand the role of inhibitory neurons in auditory processing.},

On the other hand, the digital era has brought major changes to scientific knowledge production. First, there is a cyberinfrastructure\textemdash not only infrastructure for computing, but a major virtual lab where all professionals in science and technology (e.g., researchers, engineers, technicians) can collaborate and exchange data, information, and knowledge. In Europe, this new infrastructure is referred to as e-science. Second, the digital era has increased coproduction beyond frontiers of traditional players, bringing other participants to scientific development. Such kind of co-work is central to both citizen science and transdisciplinary knowledge coproduction, where non-academic players engage in activities such as planning, data gathering, and impact assessment of science. In this chapter, we define digital science as a convergent phenomenon of cyberinfrastructure, e-science, citizen science and transdisciplinarity. We examine how digital science has been a disruptive factor to traditional scientific development, changing productivity, expanding frontiers and challenging traditional processes in science, such as planning and assessment.},

  abstract = {Advances in silicon probe technology mean that in vivo electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of channels will soon become commonplace. To interpret these recordings we need fast, scalable and accurate methods for spike sorting, whose output requires minimal time for manual curation. Here we introduce Kilosort, a spike sorting framework that meets these criteria, and show that it allows rapid and accurate sorting of large-scale in vivo data. Kilosort models the recorded voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times, allowing overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Rapid processing is achieved thanks to a novel low-dimensional approximation for the spatiotemporal distribution of each template, and to batch-based optimization on GPUs. A novel post-clustering merging step based on the continuity of the templates substantially reduces the requirement for subsequent manual curation operations. We compare Kilosort to an established algorithm on data obtained from 384-channel electrodes, and show superior performance, at much reduced processing times. Data from 384-channel electrode arrays can be processed in approximately realtime. Kilosort is an important step towards fully automated spike sorting of multichannel electrode recordings, and is freely available (github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort).},

  abstract = {Neuroscience is experiencing a revolution in which simultaneous recording of thousands of neurons is revealing population dynamics that are not apparent from single-neuron responses. This structure is typically extracted from data averaged across many trials, but deeper understanding requires studying phenomena detected in single trials, which is challenging due to incomplete sampling of the neural population, trial-to-trial variability, and fluctuations in action potential timing. We introduce latent factor analysis via dynamical systems, a deep learning method to infer latent dynamics from single-trial neural spiking data. When applied to a variety of macaque and human motor cortical datasets, latent factor analysis via dynamical systems accurately predicts observed behavioral variables, extracts precise firing rate estimates of neural dynamics on single trials, infers perturbations to those dynamics that correlate with behavioral choices, and combines data from non-overlapping recording sessions spanning months to improve inference of underlying dynamics.},

  abstract = {The rat auditory cortex is divided anatomically into several areas, but little is known about the functional differences in information processing between these areas. To determine the filter properties of rat posterior auditory field (PAF) neurons, we compared neurophysiological responses to simple tones, frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and amplitude modulated noise and tones with responses of primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons. PAF neurons have excitatory receptive fields that are on average 65\% broader than A1 neurons. The broader receptive fields of PAF neurons result in responses to narrow and broadband inputs that are stronger than A1. In contrast to A1, we found little evidence for an orderly topographic gradient in PAF based on frequency. These neurons exhibit latencies that are twice as long as A1. In response to modulated tones and noise, PAF neurons adapt to repeated stimuli at significantly slower rates. Unlike A1, neurons in PAF rarely exhibit facilitation to rapidly repeated sounds. Neurons in PAF do not exhibit strong selectivity for rate or direction of narrowband one octave FM sweeps. These results indicate that PAF, like nonprimary visual fields, processes sensory information on larger spectral and longer temporal scales than primary cortex.},

However, the majority of the existing FL frameworks rely on centralized entities. In this work, we introduce IPLS, a fully decentralized federated learning framework that is partially based on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). By using IPLS and connecting into the corresponding private IPFS network, any party can initiate the training process of an ML model or join an ongoing training process that has already been started by another party. IPLS scales with the number of participants, is robust against intermittent connectivity and dynamic participant departures/arrivals, requires minimal resources, and guarantees that the accuracy of the trained model quickly converges to that of a centralized FL framework with an accuracy drop of less than one per thousand.},

In olfaction, odor concentration changes across consecutive inhalations ({$\Delta$}Ct) can guide odor source localization, yet the neural representation of {$\Delta$}Ct has not been studied in vertebrates. We have found that, in the mouse olfactory bulb, a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells represents {$\Delta$}Ct, enhancing the contrast between different concentrations. These concentration change responses are direction selective: they respond either to increments or decrements of concentration, reminiscent of ON and OFF selectivity in the retina. This contrast enhancement scales with the magnitude, but not the duration of the concentration step. Further, {$\Delta$}Ct can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells represents {$\Delta$}Ct, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.},

As systematic representations of chemical odour space have not~yet been described in the olfactory cortex, it remains unclear how odour relationships are encoded to place chemically distinct but similar odours, such as lemon and orange, into perceptual categories, such as citrus5\textendash 7. Here, by combining chemoinformatics and multiphoton imaging in the mouse, we show that both the piriform cortex and its sensory inputs from the olfactory bulb represent chemical odour relationships through correlated patterns of activity. However, cortical odour codes differ from those in the bulb: cortex more strongly clusters together representations for related odours, selectively rewrites pairwise odour relationships, and better matches odour perception. The bulb-to-cortex transformation depends on the associative network originating within the piriform cortex, and can be reshaped by passive odour experience. Thus, cortex actively builds a structured representation of chemical odour space that highlights odour relationships; this representation is similar across individuals but remains plastic, suggesting a means through which the olfactory system can assign related odour cues to common and yet personalized percepts.},

  abstract = {How the human auditory system extracts perceptually relevant acoustic features of speech is unknown. To address this question, we used intracranial recordings from nonprimary auditory cortex in the human superior temporal gyrus to determine what acoustic information in speech sounds can be reconstructed from population neural activity. We found that slow and intermediate temporal fluctuations, such as those corresponding to syllable rate, were accurately reconstructed using a linear model based on the auditory spectrogram. However, reconstruction of fast temporal fluctuations, such as syllable onsets and offsets, required a nonlinear sound representation based on temporal modulation energy. Reconstruction accuracy was highest within the range of spectro-temporal fluctuations that have been found to be critical for speech intelligibility. The decoded speech representations allowed readout and identification of individual words directly from brain activity during single trial sound presentations. These findings reveal neural encoding mechanisms of speech acoustic parameters in higher order human auditory cortex.},

The use of cryptography, and of covert communication channels over public and widely used protocols and services, is becoming a norm. In this work, we start by introducing Resource Identifier Generation Algorithms. These are an extension of a well-known mechanism called Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA), which are frequently employed by cybercriminals for bot management and communication. Our extension allows, beyond DNS, the use of other protocols. More concretely, we showcase the exploitation of the InterPlanetary file system (IPFS). This is a solution for the "permanent web", which enjoys a steadily growing community interest and adoption. The IPFS is, in addition, one of the most prominent solutions for blockchain storage. We go beyond the straightforward case of using the IPFS for hosting malicious content, and explore ways in which a botmaster could employ it, to manage her bots, validating our findings experimentally. Finally, we discuss the advantages of our approach for malware authors, its efficacy and highlight its extensibility for other distributed storage services.},

Recently, semantic publishing has opened the possibility of a major step forward in the digital publishing world. For this to succeed, new semantic models and visualization tools are required to fully meet the specific needs of authors and publishers. In this article, we introduce the principles and architectures of two new ontologies central to the task of semantic publishing: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, an ontology for recording and publishing bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours on the Semantic Web, and CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, an ontology for the characterization of bibliographic citations both factually and rhetorically. We present those two models step by step, in order to emphasise their features and to stress their advantages relative to other pre-existing information models. Finally, we review the uptake of FaBiO and CiTO within the academic and publishing communities.},

The popular file distribution tool BitTorrent was explicitly designed to address this problem, using a tit-for-tat reciprocity strategy to provide positive incentives for nodes to contribute resources to the swarm. While BitTorrent has been extremely successful, we show that its incentive mechanism is not robust to strategic clients. Through performance modeling parameterized by real world traces, we demonstrate that all peers contribute resources that do not directly improve their performance. We use these results to drive the design and implementation of BitTyrant, a strategic BitTorrent client that provides a median 70\% performance gain for a 1 Mbit client on live Internet swarms. We further show that when applied universally, strategic clients can hurt average per-swarm performance compared to today's BitTorrent client implementations.},

  abstract = {The number of available Internet services increases every day. This trend demands distributed models and architectures to support scalability as well as semantics to enable efficient publication and retrieval of services. Two common approaches toward this goal are semantic overlay networks (SONs) and distributed hash tables (DHTs) with semantic extensions. SONs enable semantic-driven query answering but are less scalable than DHTs, which, in their turn, feature efficient but semantic-free query answering based on exact match. This paper presents a strategy and a system, called ERGOT, that combine DHTs and SONs to enable semantic-based service discovery in distributed infrastructures such as Grids and Clouds. ERGOT uses semantic annotations that enrich service specifications in two ways: (i) services are advertised in the DHT on the basis of their annotations, thus allowing us to establish a SON between service providers; (ii) annotations enable semantic-based service matchmaking, using a similarity measure between service requests and descriptions. An extensive evaluation of the system is presented and discussed. The experimental evaluation we carried out confirmed the efficiency of the implemented strategy in terms of both accuracy of search and network traffic.},

  abstract = {Speech perception consists of a set of computations that take continuously varying acoustic waveforms as input and generate discrete representations that make contact with the lexical representations stored in long-term memory as output. Because the perceptual objects that are recognized by the speech perception enter into subsequent linguistic computation, the format that is used for lexical representation and processing fundamentally constrains the speech perceptual processes. Consequently, theories of speech perception must, at some level, be tightly linked to theories of lexical representation. Minimally, speech perception must yield representations that smoothly and rapidly interface with stored lexical items. Adopting the perspective of Marr, we argue and provide neurobiological and psychophysical evidence for the following research programme. First, at the implementational level, speech perception is a multi-time resolution process, with perceptual analyses occurring concurrently on at least two time scales (approx. 20-80 ms, approx. 150-300 ms), commensurate with (sub)segmental and syllabic analyses, respectively. Second, at the algorithmic level, we suggest that perception proceeds on the basis of internal forward models, or uses an 'analysis-by-synthesis' approach. Third, at the computational level (in the sense of Marr), the theory of lexical representation that we adopt is principally informed by phonological research and assumes that words are represented in the mental lexicon in terms of sequences of discrete segments composed of distinctive features. One important goal of the research programme is to develop linking hypotheses between putative neurobiological primitives (e.g. temporal primitives) and those primitives derived from linguistic inquiry, to arrive ultimately at a biologically sensible and theoretically satisfying model of representation and computation in speech.},

As a cultural anthropologist, I approach this study with qualitative historical and ethnographic methodologies, positioning the community of researchers that have been involved in the design and implementation of Semantic Web protocols and technologies as my primary field site. Two concepts from Science and Technology Studies are introduced - thought styles and design logics. The paper demonstrates how diverse thinking about how to approach knowledge representation on the Web is rooted in debates that emerged in artificial intelligence in the 1970s and 1980s. It then goes on to discuss how the diverse approaches to Web semantics that emerged from these legacies have cultural and political implications. The paper concludes with a call for further research that positions Web architectures as objects of social and cultural study.},

We tested whether topographic map plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex and a secondary auditory area, the suprarhinal auditory field, was controlled by the statistics of bottom-up sensory inputs or by top-down task-dependent influences. Rats were trained to attend to independent parameters, either frequency or intensity, within an identical set of auditory stimuli, allowing us to vary task demands while holding the bottom-up sensory inputs constant. We observed a clear double-dissociation in map plasticity in both cortical fields. Rats trained to attend to frequency cues exhibited an expanded representation of the target frequency range within the tonotopic map but no change in sound intensity encoding compared with controls. Rats trained to attend to intensity cues expressed an increased proportion of nonmonotonic intensity response profiles preferentially tuned to the target intensity range but no change in tonotopic map organization relative to controls. The degree of topographic map plasticity within the task-relevant stimulus dimension was correlated with the degree of perceptual learning for rats in both tasks. These data suggest that enduring receptive field plasticity in the adult auditory cortex may be shaped by task-specific top-down inputs that interact with bottom-up sensory inputs and reinforcement-based neuromodulator release. Top-down inputs might confer the selectivity necessary to modify a single feature representation without affecting other spatially organized feature representations embedded within the same neural circuitry.},

This issue is investigated quantitatively by connecting it with the way authorship on papers is distributed. I analyzed a large bibliographic dataset made available by Microsoft under the name Academic Graph  to create a histogram with the number of articles an author produces per year. The histogram has the shape of a pyramid, and different layers in it correlate with positions in the academic hierarchy. The super-prolific authors at the top of the pyramid with more than 40 publications per year are usually heads of large institutes with many subgroups and large numbers of PhD students, while the bottom of the pyramid is populated by PhD students and Postdocs with less than 5 publications per year. The mechanism that allows 'manager scientists' to appropriate publications generated in their sphere of influence is related to other issues, such as the evaluation of scientific performance based on scientometric indicators and the lenient enforcement of authorship rules. A new index, the Ponzi factor, is proposed to quantify this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {This essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing, with special attention to the example of Elsevier. A scholarly publisher can be defined as a surveillance publisher if it derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from prediction products, fueled by data extracted from researcher behavior. The essay begins by tracing the Google search engine's roots in bibliometrics, alongside a history of the citation analysis company that became, in 2016, Clarivate. The point is to show the co-evolution of scholarly communication and the surveillance advertising economy. The essay then refines the idea of surveillance publishing by engaging with the work of Shoshana Zuboff, Jathan Sadowski, Mariano-Florentino Cu\'ellar, and Aziz Huq. The recent history of Elsevier is traced to describe the company's research-lifecycle data-harvesting strategy, with the aim to develop and sell prediction products to universities and other customers. The essay concludes by considering some of the potential costs of surveillance publishing, as other big commercial publishers increasingly enter the predictive-analytics mark. It is likely, I argue, that windfall subscription-and-APC profits in Elsevier's ``legacy'' publishing business have financed its decade-long acquisition binge in analytics, with the implication that university customers are budgetary victims twice over. The products' purpose, I stress, is to streamline the top-down assessment and evaluation practices that have taken hold in recent decades, in tandem with the view that the university's main purpose is to grow regional and national economies. A final pair of concerns is that publishers' prediction projects may camouflage and perpetuate existing biases in the system\textemdash and that scholars may internalize an analytics mindset, one already encouraged by citation counts and impact factors.},

  abstract = {Of the many P2P file-sharing prototypes in existence, BitTorrent is one of the few that has managed to attract millions of users. BitTorrent relies on other (global) components for file search, employs a moderator system to ensure the integrity of file data, and uses a bartering technique for downloading in order to prevent users from freeriding. In this paper we present a measurement study of BitTorrent in which we focus on four issues, viz. availability, integrity, flashcrowd handling, and download performance. The purpose of this paper is to aid in the understanding of a real P2P system that apparently has the right mechanisms to attract a large user community, to provide measurement data that may be useful in modeling P2P systems, and to identify design issues in such systems.},

This is a structural problem in society, and astronomy is not immune to it. Although we talk about the challenges faced by `women and minorities', it is all too rare to acknowledge intersecting realities: some of us are minority women and our experiences are different from both white women and minority men, with sexism and racism compounding in nonlinear ways. Confronting the challenges associated with invoking an intersectional analysis can be daunting if the mainstream community continues to ignore helpful work from the social sciences, which can teach us new ways of understanding how we produce scientific knowledge. Rather than failing to question how science is done, we should let curiosity be our guide.},

  abstract = {A set of left frontal, temporal, and parietal brain regions respond robustly during language comprehension and production (e.g., Fedorenko E, Hsieh PJ, Nieto-Casta\~n\'on A, Whitfield-Gabrieli S, Kanwisher N. J Neurophysiol 104: 1177\textendash 1194, 2010; Menenti L, Gierhan SM, Segaert K, Hagoort P. Psychol Sci 22: 1173\textendash 1182, 2011). These regions have been further shown to be selective for language relative to other cognitive processes, including arithmetic, aspects of executive function, and music perception (e.g., Fedorenko E, Behr MK, Kanwisher N. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108: 16428\textendash 16433, 2011; Monti MM, Osherson DN. Brain Res 1428: 33\textendash 42, 2012). However, one claim about overlap between language and nonlinguistic cognition remains prominent. In particular, some have argued that language processing shares computational demands with action observation and/or execution (e.g., Rizzolatti G, Arbib MA. Trends Neurosci 21: 188\textendash 194, 1998; Koechlin E, Jubault T. Neuron 50: 963\textendash 974, 2006; Tettamanti M, Weniger D. Cortex 42: 491\textendash 494, 2006). However, the evidence for these claims is indirect, based on observing activation for language and action tasks within the same broad anatomical areas (e.g., on the lateral surface of the left frontal lobe). To test whether language indeed shares machinery with action observation/execution, we examined the responses of language brain regions, defined functionally in each individual participant (Fedorenko E, Hsieh PJ, Nieto-Casta\~n\'on A, Whitfield-Gabrieli S, Kanwisher N. J Neurophysiol 104: 1177\textendash 1194, 2010) to action observation (experiments 1, 2, and 3a) and action imitation (experiment 3b). With the exception of the language region in the angular gyrus, all language regions, including those in the inferior frontal gyrus (within ``Broca's area''), showed little or no response during action observation/imitation. These results add to the growing body of literature suggesting that high-level language regions are highly selective for language processing (see Fedorenko E, Varley R. Ann NY Acad Sci 1369: 132\textendash 153, 2016 for a review).NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Many have argued for overlap in the machinery used to interpret language and others' actions, either because action observation was a precursor to linguistic communication or because both require interpreting hierarchically-structured stimuli. However, existing evidence is indirect, relying on group analyses or reverse inference. We examined responses to action observation in language regions defined functionally in individual participants and found no response. Thus language comprehension and action observation recruit distinct circuits in the modern brain.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the political position of academic librarianship in the context of recent changes in English Higher Education. The neoliberalisation of academic librarianship, both as an academic discipline and profession, is considered. The emergence of the Radical Librarians Collective is examined as a potential site through which to counter these developments and foster radical alternatives. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws upon Gramsci's concepts of hegemony and praxis, and post-structural critiques of neoliberalism, as a theoretical framework to guide data collection and analysis, and observe developments within academic librarianship vis-\`a-vis broader processes of neoliberalisation. Empirical data collected through interviews and participant observation are analysed using thematic and critical discourse analysis. Findings The research finds that academic librarianship as a discipline and practice is undergoing a process of neoliberalisation. An umbrella organisation of activist librarians, Radical Librarians Collective, is found to be resisting these developments and has some potential to become a space through which radical alternatives to neoliberal hegemony can be explored and fostered. Research limitations/implications The research demonstrates the utility of a Gramscian theoretical framework as a lens through which to observe developments in the field of library and information studies (LIS). Further empirical work would deepen the authors' understanding of such developments across a range of institutions and locales. Originality/value The research makes an original contribution to critical research on the struggles around the neoliberalisation of academic librarianship in the UK. The theoretically informed analysis provides original insights into these processes, and makes a methodological contribution to LIS research.},

  abstract = {Identifying behaviorally relevant sounds in the presence of background noise is one of the most important and poorly understood challenges faced by the auditory system. An elegant solution to this problem would be for the auditory system to represent sounds in a noise-invariant fashion. Since a major effect of background noise is to alter the statistics of the sounds reaching the ear, noise-invariant representations could be promoted by neurons adapting to stimulus statistics. Here we investigated the extent of neuronal adaptation to the mean and contrast of auditory stimulation as one ascends the auditory pathway. We measured these forms of adaptation by presenting complex synthetic and natural sounds, recording neuronal responses in the inferior colliculus and primary fields of the auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets, and comparing these responses with a sophisticated model of the auditory nerve. We find that the strength of both forms of adaptation increases as one ascends the auditory pathway. To investigate whether this adaptation to stimulus statistics contributes to the construction of noise-invariant sound representations, we also presented complex, natural sounds embedded in stationary noise, and used a decoding approach to assess the noise tolerance of the neuronal population code. We find that the code for complex sounds in the periphery is affected more by the addition of noise than the cortical code. We also find that noise tolerance is correlated with adaptation to stimulus statistics, so that populations that show the strongest adaptation to stimulus statistics are also the most noise-tolerant. This suggests that the increase in adaptation to sound statistics from auditory nerve to midbrain to cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations in the higher auditory brain.},

One important property is the spectrotemporal contrast in the acoustic environment: the variation in sound pressure in each frequency band, relative to the mean pressure. We show that neurons in ferret auditory cortex rescale their gain to partially compensate for the spectrotemporal contrast of recent stimulation. When contrast is low, neurons increase their gain, becoming more sensitive to small changes in the stimulus, although the effectiveness of contrast gain control is reduced at low mean levels. Gain is primarily determined by contrast near each neuron's preferred frequency, but there is also a contribution from contrast in more distant frequency bands. Neural responses are modulated by contrast over timescales of {$\sim$}100~ms. By using contrast gain control to expand or compress the representation of its inputs, the auditory system may be seeking an efficient coding of natural sounds.},

In the first experiment, audiograms were constructed for five CBA/CaJ mice. Thresholds were obtained for eight pure tones ranging in frequency from 1 to 42 kHz. Audiograms showed peak sensitivity between 8 and 24 kHz, with higher thresholds at lower and higher frequencies. In the second experiment, thresholds for gap detection in broadband and narrowband noise bursts were measured at several sensation levels. For broadband noise, gap thresholds were between 1 and 2 ms, except at very low sensation levels, where thresholds increased significantly. Gap thresholds also increased significantly for low pass-filtered noise bursts with a cutoff frequency below 18 kHz. Our experiments revised absolute auditory thresholds in the CBA/CaJ mouse strain and demonstrated excellent gap detection ability in the mouse. These results add to the baseline behavioral data from normal-hearing mice which have become increasingly important for assessing auditory abilities in genetically altered mice.},

Here, using techniques from Theoretical Computer Science, we examine how many experiments are needed to obtain such an empirical understanding. It is proved, mathematically, that establishing the most extensive notions of understanding \emph{need} exponentially-many experiments in the number of neurons, in general, unless a widely-posited hypothesis about computation is false. Worse still, the feasible experimental regime is one where the number of experiments scales sub-linearly in the number of neurons, suggesting a fundamental impediment to such an understanding.

As a result, the activity of these neurons becomes less redundant than lower levels. We recorded responses to speech sounds from the inferior colliculus and the primary auditory cortex neurons of rats, and tested the hypothesis that primary auditory cortex neurons are more sensitive to combinations of multiple acoustic parameters compared to inferior colliculus neurons. We independently eliminated periodicity information, spectral information and temporal information in each consonant and vowel sound using a noise vocoder. This technique made it possible to test several key hypotheses about speech sound processing. Our results demonstrate that inferior colliculus responses are spatially arranged and primarily determined by the spectral energy and the fundamental frequency of speech, whereas primary auditory cortex neurons generate widely distributed responses to multiple acoustic parameters, and are not strongly influenced by the fundamental frequency of speech. We found no evidence that inferior colliculus or primary auditory cortex was specialized for speech features such as voice onset time or formants. The greater diversity of responses in primary auditory cortex compared to inferior colliculus may help explain how the auditory system can identify a wide range of speech sounds across a wide range of conditions without relying on any single acoustic cue. ?? 2013 IBRO.},

To realise this promise, however, is not straightforward. In this paper, based on ethnographic observation, we argue that the challenges for ontology building are `social' as much as they are technical. By this we mean the routine work undertaken in the building process and the problems and difficulties entailed can be understood in terms of the practices of knowledge workers and the practical nature of `sorting things out'. Getting a better sense of how, in practise, this work gets done gives a sense of the main challenges of building successful ontologies and how this impacts on the design of tool support. In considering the practices of one group in particular, we try to show how, for members, the technical problems of determining what classification structure is appropriate, and what its boundaries might be, depend substantially on assumptions about the `community' and its interests and purposes. This `turn to the social' has ramifications for the understanding of ontology building and use. Specifically, `modelling' approaches to ontology building tell us little about the practical organisation of the work and how this relates to the prospect of successful sharing. Ethnographic enquiry may reveal important issues that are otherwise missed.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL)-based predictive models from electronic health records (EHRs) deliver impressive performance in many clinical tasks. Large training cohorts, however, are often required by these models to achieve high accuracy, hindering the adoption of DL-based models in scenarios with limited training data. Recently, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and related models have achieved tremendous successes in the natural language processing domain. The pretraining of BERT on a very large training corpus generates contextualized embeddings that can boost the performance of models trained on smaller datasets. Inspired by BERT, we propose Med-BERT, which adapts the BERT framework originally developed for the text domain to the structured EHR domain. Med-BERT is a contextualized embedding model pretrained on a structured EHR dataset of 28,490,650 patients. Fine-tuning experiments showed that Med-BERT substantially improves the prediction accuracy, boosting the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by 1.21\textendash 6.14\% in two disease prediction tasks from two clinical databases. In particular, pretrained Med-BERT obtains promising performances on tasks with small fine-tuning training sets and can boost the AUC by more than 20\% or obtain an AUC as high as a model trained on a training set ten times larger, compared with deep learning models without Med-BERT. We believe that Med-BERT will benefit disease prediction studies with small local training datasets, reduce data collection expenses, and accelerate the pace of artificial intelligence aided healthcare.},

However, the physiological processes linking cortical state and pupil variations are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that these rapid variations, during both quiet waking and locomotion, are highly correlated with fluctuations in the activity of corticopetal noradrenergic and cholinergic projections. Rapid dilations of the pupil are tightly associated with phasic activity in noradrenergic axons, whereas longer-lasting dilations of the pupil, such as during locomotion, are accompanied by sustained activity in cholinergic axons. Thus, the pupil can be used to sensitively track the activity in multiple neuromodulatory transmitter systems as they control the state of the waking brain.},

It relies on primitive devices akin to the Gestalt principles of organization to assign sensory elements to probable groupings and invokes secondary schematic processes to confirm or to repair the possible organization. Although this conceptualization is intended to apply universally, the variety and arrangement of acoustic constituents of speech violate Gestalt principles at numerous junctures, cohering perceptually, nonetheless. The authors report 3 experiments on organization in phonetic perception, using sine wave synthesis to evade the Gestalt rules and the schematic processes alike. These findings falsify a general auditory account, showing that phonetic perceptual organization is achieved by specific sensitivity to the acoustic modulations characteristic of speech signals.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the initial component of the stop consonant release burst, the release transient. In theory, the transient, because of its impulselike source, should contain much information about the vocal tract configuration at release, but it is usually weak in intensity and difficult to isolate from the accompanying frication in natural speech. For this investigation, a human talker produced isolated release transients of /b,d,g/ in nine vocalic contexts by whispering these syllables very quietly. He also produced the corresponding CV syllables with regular phonation for comparison. Spectral analyses showed the isolated transients to have a clearly defined formant structure, which was not seen in natural release bursts, whose spectra were dominated by the frication noise. The formant frequencies varied systematically with both consonant place of articulation and vocalic context. Perceptual experiments showed that listeners can identify both consonants and vowels from isolated transients, though not very accurately. Knowing one of the two segments in advance did not help, but when the transients were followed by a compatible synthetic, steady-state vowel, consonant identification improved somewhat. On the whole, isolated transients, despite their clear formant structure, provided only partial information for consonant identification, but no less so, it seems, than excerpted natural release bursts. The information conveyed by artificially isolated transients and by natural (frication-dominated) release bursts appears to be perceptually equivalent.},

  abstract = {A great deal of research on geographically distributed organizing focuses on communication among members; however, in the face of increasingly large, complex and interdependent infrastructure, scholars must also examine instances of technology-supported coordination that function by replacing rather than enhancing human communication among organizational members. Central to this are complex processes of delegation \textemdash{} in which organizational work and agency are passed back and forth across the shifting line between ``social'' and ``technical'' elements. Building on work in the sociology of science, this paper extends the concept of delegation and applies it to thorny questions around the work of sustaining organization over time. We explore two examples from the Open Science Grid (OSG), an initiative that distributes computational resources to geographically dispersed and otherwise loosely coordinated research teams. Our first case is one of successful delegation, as automated access to resources is extended to a new group of distributed scientists. We then turn our attention to a case where the process of delegation breaks down, revealing the usually invisible work needed to sustain ``seamless'' integration. As these cases show, delegation is complex, fragile, and central to the nature of contemporary organizing. Specifically, delegation: 1) reconfigures the organization of work; 2) transforms how outcomes are accomplished; 3) redistributes responsibility for organizational decision-making; and 4) shifts the visibility and invisibility of both actors and their work.},

Members of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study have been investigating AIDS for over 30\,years, and in that time, the disease has been repeatedly transformed. Over the years and across many changes, members have continued to study HIV disease while in the process regenerating an adaptable research organization. The key to sustaining this technoscientific flexibility has been what we call the kernel of a research infrastructure: ongoing efforts to maintain the availability of resources and services that may be brought to bear in the investigation of new objects. In the case of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, these resources are as follows: specimens and data, calibrated instruments, heterogeneous experts, and participating cohorts of gay and bisexual men. We track three ontological transformations, examining how members prepared for and responded to changes: the discovery of a novel retroviral agent (HIV), the ability to test for that agent, and the transition of the disease from fatal to chronic through pharmaceutical intervention. Respectively, we call the work, `technologies', and techniques of adapting to these changes, `repurposing', `elaborating', and `extending the kernel'.},

Our study contributes by revealing how the different motivations of OSS developers are interrelated, how these motivations influence participation leading to performance, and how past performance influences subsequent motivations. Drawing on theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, we develop a theoretical model relating the motivations, participation, and performance of OSS developers. We evaluate our model using survey and archival data collected from a longitudinal field study of software developers in the Apache projects. Our results reveal several important findings. First, we find that developers' motivations are not independent but rather are related in complex ways. Being paid to contribute to Apache projects is positively related to developers' status motivations but negatively related to their use-value motivations. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no evidence of diminished intrinsic motivation in the presence of extrinsic motivations; rather, status motivations enhance intrinsic motivations. Second, we find that different motivations have an impact on participation in different ways. Developers' paid participation and status motivations lead to above-average contribution levels, but use-value motivations lead to below-average contribution levels, and intrinsic motivations do not significantly impact average contribution levels. Third, we find that developers' contribution levels positively impact their performance rankings. Finally, our results suggest that past-performance rankings enhance developers' subsequent status motivations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We discuss ways in which Marr's framework may be extended to other areas of psychology, such as social, developmental, and evolutionary psychology, bringing new benefits to these fields. Next, we show how theoretical analyses can endow a theory with minimal plausibility even prior to contact with empirical data: we call this the theoretical cycle. Finally, we explain how our proposal may contribute to addressing critical issues in psychological science, including how to leverage effects to understand capacities better.},

Moreover, our theory provides a broadly applicable procedure to construct PALOs that requires neither a steady-state nor Markovian dynamics. Using our theory, we show that every bipartite stochastic process has a causal blanket, but the extent to which this leads to an effective PALO formulation varies depending on the integrated information of the bipartition.},

In taxonomies of concrete objects, there is one level of abstraction at which the most basic category cuts are made. Basic categories are those which carry the most information, possess the highest category cue validity, and are, thus, the most differentiated from one another. The four experiments of Part I define basic objects by demonstrating that in taxonomies of common concrete nouns in English based on class inclusion, basic objects are the most inclusive categories whose members: (a) possess significant numbers of attributes in common, (b) have motor programs which are similar to one another, (c) have similar shapes, and (d) can be identified from averaged shapes of members of the class. The eight experiments of Part II explore implications of the structure of categories. Basic objects are shown to be the most inclusive categories for which a concrete image of the category as a whole can be formed, to be the first categorizations made during perception of the environment, to be the earliest categories sorted and earliest named by children, and to be the categories most codable, most coded, and most necessary in language.},

In Experiments 1 and 3, subjects listed attributes for members of semantic categories which had been previously rated for degree of prototypicality. High positive correlations were obtained between those ratings and the extent of distribution of an item's attributes among the other items of the category. In Experiments 2 and 4, subjects listed superordinates of category members and listed attributes of members of contrasting categories. Negative correlations were obtained between prototypicality and superordinates other than the category in question and between prototypicality and an item's possession of attributes possessed by members of contrasting categories. Experiments 5 and 6 used artificial categories and showed that family resemblance within categories and lack of overlap of elements with contrasting categories were correlated with ease of learning, reaction time in identifying an item after learning, and rating of prototypicality of an item. It is argued that family resemblance offers an alternative to criterial features in defining categories.},

Categorization is the area in cognitive psychology which deals with the ancient problem of universals, that is, with the fact that unique particular objects or events can be treated equivalently.

However, Wittgenstein's later philosophy has revolutionary implications for many aspects of human thought, among them issues in categorization. In this paper, I will argue that modern research in natural categories is actually derived from Wittgensteinian insights, but ambivalently so: It has tended to work with the symptoms rather than the root of his challenge.},

Imaging research suggests that the brain treats auditory and visual speech similarly. These findings have led some researchers to consider that speech perception works by extracting amodal information that takes the same form across modalities. From this perspective, speech integration is a property of the input information itself. Amodal speech information could explain the reported automaticity, immediacy, and completeness of audiovisual speech integration. However, recent findings suggest that speech integration can be influenced by higher cognitive properties such as lexical status and semantic context. Proponents of amodal accounts will need to explain these results.},

Good professional practice (and avoiding charges of plagiarism) requires us to attribute ideas and words to specific historians\textemdash we are taught to speak of ``Richard Hofstadter's status anxiety interpretation of Progressivism.''2 And if we use more than a limited number of words from Hofstadter, we need to send a check to his estate.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a lightweight method for detecting and classifying BitTorrent content providers with a minimal amount of resources. While heavy methodologies are typically used (which require long term observation and data exchange with peers of the swarm and/or a semantic analysis of torrent websites), we instead argue that such complexity can be avoided by analyzing the correlations between peers and torrents. We apply our methodology to study over 50K torrents injected in ThePirateBay during one month, collecting more than 400K IPs addresses. Shortly, we find that exploiting the correlations not only enhances the classification accuracy keeping the technique lightweight (our methodology reliably identifies about 150 seedboxes), but also uncovers seeding behaviors that were not previously noticed (e.g., as multi-port and multi-host seeding). Finally, we correlate the popularity of seedbox hosting in our dataset to criteria (e.g., cost, storage space, Web popularity) that can bias the selection process of BitTorrent content providers.},

  abstract = {Global digital platforms are conquering the world and rely critically on digital infrastructures to function, yet little research has explored the fundamental interrelationship between the two. This working paper argues that understanding centralization and decentralization in digital networks as asymmetry and symmetry in mutual interdependencies between the constitutive elements of a digital network can help us understand the platform-infrastructure relationship more fundamentally (and vice versa). To this end, the paper proposes, as a starting point, the in-depth analytical and literature study of blockchain networks as a particularly revealing type of digital platform/infrastructure duality. The paper proposes an analytical model for characterizing de/centralization in digital networks and maps this onto blockchain networks. Based on this, the paper explores the de/centralization of blockchain, arguing that the extant blockchain literature largely has failed in providing a comprehensive understanding of de/centralization by not considering the complex second-order interdependencies between the different constitutive dimensions of a blockchain: the symbolic, technological and political dimension. Based on this, the paper provides an analysis of the meaning of de/centralization in blockchain networks by studying the interdependencies between its constitutive elements of coin, network technology, and social community.},

Understanding the brain requires integration of data across this diversity, and thus these data must be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). This requires a standard language for data and metadata that can coevolve with neuroscience. We describe design and implementation principles for a language for neurophysiology data. Our software (Neurodata Without Borders, NWB) defines and modularizes the interdependent, yet separable, components of a data language. We demonstrate NWB's impact through unified description of neurophysiology data across diverse modalities and species. NWB exists in an ecosystem which includes data management, analysis, visualization, and archive tools. Thus, the NWB data language enables reproduction, interchange, and reuse of diverse neurophysiology data. More broadly, the design principles of NWB are generally applicable to enhance discovery across biology through data FAIRness.},

Here we analyze the behavior of asymmetrical connected networks of linear threshold neurons, whose positive response is unbounded. We show that, for a wide range of parameters, this asymmetry brings interesting and computationally useful dynamical properties. When driven by input, the network explores potential solutions through highly unstable 'expansion' dynamics. This expansion is steered and constrained by negative divergence of the dynamics, which ensures that the dimensionality of the solution space continues to reduce until an acceptable solution manifold is reached. Then the system contracts stably on this manifold towards its final solution trajectory. The unstable positive feedback and cross inhibition that underlie expansion and divergence are common motifs in molecular and neuronal networks. Therefore we propose that very simple organizational constraints that combine these motifs can lead to spontaneous computation and so to the spontaneous modification of entropy that is characteristic of living systems.},

  abstract = {In the auditory cortex of awake animals, a substantial number of neurons do not respond to pure tones. These neurons have historically been classified as "unresponsive" and even been speculated as being nonauditory. We discovered, however, that many of these neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake marmoset monkeys were in fact highly selective for complex sound features. We then investigated how such selectivity might arise from the tone-tuned inputs that these neurons likely receive. We found that these non-tone responsive neurons exhibited nonlinear combination-sensitive responses that require precise spectral and temporal combinations of two tone pips. The nonlinear spectrotemporal maps derived from these neurons were correlated with their selectivity for complex acoustic features. These non-tone responsive and nonlinear neurons were commonly encountered at superficial cortical depths in A1. Our findings demonstrate how temporally and spectrally specific nonlinear integration of putative tone-tuned inputs might underlie a diverse range of high selectivity of A1 neurons in awake animals. We propose that describing A1 neurons with complex response properties in terms of tone-tuned input channels can conceptually unify a wide variety of observed neural selectivity to complex sounds into a lower dimensional description.},

Behavior is plausibly shaped by both the sensory receptors and the environments for which organisms are optimized, but their roles are often opaque. One classic example is pitch perception, whose properties are commonly linked to peripheral neural coding limits rather than environmental acoustic constraints. We trained artificial neural networks to estimate fundamental frequency from simulated cochlear representations of natural sounds. The best-performing networks replicated many characteristics of human pitch judgments. To probe how our ears and environment shape these characteristics, we optimized networks given altered cochleae or sound statistics. Human-like behavior emerged only when cochleae had high temporal fidelity and when models were optimized for natural sounds. The results suggest pitch perception is critically shaped by the constraints of natural environments in addition to those of the cochlea, illustrating the use of contemporary neural networks to reveal underpinnings of behavior.},

In Solid architecture, applications can operate over data owned by the user or the user has access to regardless the location of this data on the Web. Users can also control access to their data, and have the option to switch between applications at any time. This is paradigm shift in integrating social features into Web applications.

  abstract = {Neuroscience needs behavior, and behavioral experiments require the coordination of large numbers of heterogeneous hardware components and data streams. Currently available tools strongly limit the complexity and reproducibility of experiments. Here we introduce Autopilot, a complete, open-source Python framework for experimental automation that distributes experiments over networked swarms of Raspberry Pis. Autopilot enables qualitatively greater experimental flexibility by allowing arbitrary numbers of hardware components to be combined in arbitrary experimental designs. Research is made reproducible by documenting all data and task design parameters in a human-readable and pub- lishable format at the time of collection. Autopilot provides a high-level set of programming tools while maintaining submillisecond performance at a fraction of the cost of traditional tools. Taking seriously the social nature of code, we scaffold shared knowledge and practice with a publicly editable semantic wiki and a permissive plugin system. Autopilot's flexible, scalable architecture allows neuroscientists to work together to design the next generation of experiments to investigate the behaving brainCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Decades of work have shown that even before they can talk, human infants are quickly tuning into the properties of the language(s) spoken in their environment. By their first birthday, they have already become attuned to the sounds of their language(s), processing native phonetic contrasts more easily than non-native ones. For example, between 6-8 months and 10-12 months, infants learning American English get better at distinguishing American English [{$\Elztrnr$}] and [l], as in `rock' vs `lock', relative to infants learning Japanese. This phenomenon has been dubbed early phonetic learning and has been taken as evidence that, during the first year of life, infants form phonetic categories like [{$\Elztrnr$}] and [l]. We present evidence that calls this interpretation into question. We show that a machine learning model trained without supervision on raw, unsegmented speech recordings can predict the documented changes in discrimination of [{$\Elztrnr$}] and [l] in Japanese and American English infants\textemdash but that it does so by learning units that are too localised in time and acoustically variable to correspond to phonetic categories. These results constitute the first demonstration of a feasible mechanism for early phonetic learning under realistic learning conditions. They help resolve a tension between the hypothesis that early phonetic learning is driven by statistical analysis of the speech sounds in the infant's environment, and the difficulty encountered by computational models to robustly discover phonetic categories using such mechanisms. More broadly, our results challenge the view commonly held for several decades that perceptual changes in infancy constitute evidence for the early formation of phonetic categories, and invite us to reconsider the nature of early linguistic knowledge. Our model provides one possible alternative to phonetic categories, but many others can and should be investigated.},

  abstract = {Speech sound contrasts differ along multiple phonetic dimensions. During speech perception, listeners must decide which cues are relevant, and determine the relative importance of each cue, while also integrating other, signal-external cues. The comparison of cue weighting in perception and production bears on a range of theoretical issues including the processes underlying sound change, the time course of learning, the nature of cues, and the perception-production interface. Research examining the relative alignment of cue weighting across the modalities, on both a community and individual level, has revealed both parallels and asymmetries between the modalities. The extraordinarily wide range of ways that have been used to conceptualize and quantify cue weights reflects the inherent theoretical, methodological, and analytical differences between the two modalities. More consideration of the choices of analytical metrics, explicit discussion of the theoretical assumptions that underlie them, and systematic investigations of different types of cues will lead to more generalizable findings that can be incorporated into computational implementable models of speech processing.

Since its description in human infants, statistical learning has been described in human adults and several non-human species as a general process by which animals learn about stimulus-relevant statistics. The neurobiology of statistical learning is beginning to be understood, but many questions remain about the underlying mechanisms. Why is the developing brain particularly sensitive to stimulus and environmental statistics, and what neural processes are engaged in the adult brain to enable learning from statistical regularities in the absence of external reward or instruction? This review will survey the statistical learning abilities of humans and non-human animals with a particular focus on communicative vocalizations. We discuss the neurobiological basis of statistical learning, and specifically what can be learned by exploring this process in both humans and laboratory animals. Finally, we describe advantages of studying vocal communication in rodents as a means to further our understanding of the cortical plasticity mechanisms engaged during statistical learning. We examine the use of rodents in the context of pup retrieval, which is an auditory-based and experience-dependent form of maternal behavior.},

A wide range of software is available\textemdash from commercial to academic, special-purpose to Swiss army knife, small to large\textemdash but a key characteristic of software that is suitable for scientific inquiry is its accessibility. Open-source software is ideal for scientific endeavors because it can be freely inspected, modified, and redistributed; in particular, the open-software platform ImageJ has had a huge impact on the life sciences, and continues to do so. From its inception, ImageJ has grown significantly due largely to being freely available and its vibrant and helpful user community. Scientists as diverse as interested hobbyists, technical assistants, students, scientific staff, and advanced biology researchers use ImageJ on a daily basis, and exchange knowledge via its dedicated mailing list. Uses of ImageJ range from data visualization and teaching to advanced image processing and statistical analysis. The software's extensibility continues to attract biologists at all career stages as well as computer scientists who wish to effectively implement specific image-processing algorithms. In this review, we use the ImageJ project as a case study of how open-source software fosters its suites of software tools, making multitudes of image-analysis technology easily accessible to the scientific community. We specifically explore what makes ImageJ so popular, how it impacts the life sciences, how it inspires other projects, and how it is self-influenced by coevolving projects within the ImageJ ecosystem.

  abstract = {Comparing phoneme classification and discrimination (or "categorical perception") of a stimulus continuum has for a long time been regarded as a useful method for investigating the storage and retrieval of phoneme categories in long-term memory. The closeness of the relationship between the two tasks, i.e. the degree of categorical perception, depends on a number of factors, some of which are unknown or random. One very important factor, however, seems to be the degree of bias (in the signal-detection sense of the term) in the discrimination task. When the task is such (as it is in 2IFC, for example) that the listener has to rely heavily on an internal, subjective, criterion, discrimination can seem to be almost perfectly categorical, if the stimuli are natural enough. Presenting the same stimuli in a much less biasing task, however, leads to discrimination results that are completely unrelated to phoneme classification. Even the otherwise ubiquitous peak at the phoneme boundary has disappeared. The traditional categorical-perception experiment measures the bias inherent in the discrimination task; if we want to know how speech sounds are categorized, we will have to look elsewhere. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the solutions found by learning and the effect of initial connectivity are not well understood. Here, we examine RNNs trained using gradient descent on different tasks inspired by the neuroscience literature. We find that the changes in recurrent connectivity can be described by low-rank matrices, despite the unconstrained nature of the learning algorithm. To identify the origin of the low-rank structure, we turn to an analytically tractable setting: training a linear RNN on a simplified task. We show how the low-dimensional task structure leads to low-rank changes to connectivity. This low-rank structure allows us to explain and quantify the phenomenon of accelerated learning in the presence of random initial connectivity. Altogether, our study opens a new perspective to understanding trained RNNs in terms of both the learning process and the resulting network structure.},

They are crucial for basic forms of learning about rewards and make us strive for more rewards-an evolutionary beneficial trait. Most dopamine neurons in the midbrain of humans, monkeys, and rodents signal a reward prediction error; they are activated by more reward than predicted (positive prediction error), remain at baseline activity for fully predicted rewards, and show depressed activity with less reward than predicted (negative prediction error). The dopamine signal increases nonlinearly with reward value and codes formal economic utility. Drugs of addiction generate, hijack, and amplify the dopamine reward signal and induce exaggerated, uncontrolled dopamine effects on neuronal plasticity. The striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex also show reward prediction error coding, but only in subpopulations of neurons. Thus, the important concept of reward prediction errors is implemented in neuronal hardware.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nAbstract available from the publisher.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nAbstract available from the publisher.},

This has permitted explanations of vowel systems as structured by perception, and has led to effective substance-based theories. By contrast, stops are far less thoroughly understood. In this paper we use an articulatory-acoustic model of the vocal tract to examine stop consonant place in terms of both articulation and formant values. This allows us to locate each place of articulation in the F1-F2-F3 space, and to demonstrate in "articulatory nomograms" how formants evolve while closure is displaced from the front to the back of the vocal tract. Then, in the framework of the "Perception for Action Control Theory" that we have developed in recent years, we show that the near universal labial-coronal-velar stop series (i.e., /b d g/ or /p t k/) is a perceptually optimal structure for stops just as /i a u/ is for vowels, provided that it is embedded in a suitable perceptuo-motor framework. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {A key goal of the fair-ML community is to develop machine-learning based systems that, once introduced into a social context, can achieve social and legal outcomes such as fairness, justice, and due process. Bedrock concepts in computer science---such as abstraction and modular design---are used to define notions of fairness and discrimination, to produce fairness-aware learning algorithms, and to intervene at different stages of a decision-making pipeline to produce "fair" outcomes. In this paper, however, we contend that these concepts render technical interventions ineffective, inaccurate, and sometimes dangerously misguided when they enter the societal context that surrounds decision-making systems. We outline this mismatch with five "traps" that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.},

  abstract = {Colonialism has been among the most debated and widely deployed terms in modern translation studies. Unequal cultural exchanges and their impact on translation in the modern world has been a common theme in postcolonial studies. Apart from theoretical conceptualisations of translation, feminist postcolonial critics have highlighted the predicament of female translators or translated authors who have to suffer the double bind of patriarchy and colonialism. Some postcolonial critics have adopted what may be termed a prescriptive position on translation strategies. While cultural and linguistic incompatibilities are inevitable in any translation, postcolonial scholars are concerned about the cases where it is not simply a problem of asymmetry, but rather of inequality. Theorisations of resistant strategies have been around since the early postcolonial approaches to translation. Postcolonial scholars have drawn on anthropology to formulate resistant translation strategies. The most important contribution of postcolonial translation studies has been its investigation into the effects of power inequalities in intercultural transfer.},

  abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of a high-dimensional stimulus space, but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of the stimulus onto low-dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map the neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions. These ideas are illustrated in simulations on model visual and auditory neurons responding to natural scenes and sounds, respectively.},

To explore the current causes of women's underrepresentation in biology, we collected publicly accessible data from university directories and faculty websites about the composition of biology laboratories at leading academic institutions in the United States. We found that male faculty members tended to employ fewer female graduate students and postdoctoral researchers (postdocs) than female faculty members did. Furthermore, elite male faculty\textemdash those whose research was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, who had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, or who had won a major career award\textemdash trained significantly fewer women than other male faculty members. In contrast, elite female faculty did not exhibit a gender bias in employment patterns. New assistant professors at the institutions that we surveyed were largely comprised of postdoctoral researchers from these prominent laboratories, and correspondingly, the laboratories that produced assistant professors had an overabundance of male postdocs. Thus, one cause of the leaky pipeline in biomedical research may be the exclusion of women, or their self-selected absence, from certain high-achieving laboratories.},

The - derlying architectures share features such as decentralizaton, sharing of end system resources, autonomy, virtualization, and self-organization. These features constitute the P2P paradigm. This handbook broadly addresses a large cross-section of c- rent research and state-of-the-art reports on the nature of this paradigm from a large number of experts in the ?eld. Several trends in information and network technology such as increased perf- mance and deployment of broadband networking, wireless networking, and mobile devices are synergistic with and reinforcing the capabilities of the P2P paradigm. There is general expectation in the technical community that P2P networking will continue to be an important tool for networked applications and impact the evo- tion of the Internet. A large amount of research activity has resulted in a relatively short time, and a growing community of researchers has developed. The Handbook of Peer-to-Peer Networking is dedicated to discussions on P2P networks and their applications. This is a comprehensive book on P2P computing.},

Here in adult rats, sound evoked fear conditioning paradigm, surgical ablation and chemogenetic manipulations were used to examine the role of AAF in fear related sound context recognition. Precise surgical ablation of AAF cannot block sound evoked freezing behavior but the fear conditioning became non-selective to acoustic cue. Reversible inhibition of AAF using chemogenetic activation at either training or testing phase can both lead to strong yet non-selective sound evoked freezing behavior. These simple yet clear results suggested that in sound evoked fear conditioning, sound cue and detailed content in the cue (e.g. frequency) are processed through distinct neural circuits and AAF is a critical part in the cortex dependent pathway. In addition, AAF is needed and playing a gating role for precise recognition of sound content in fear conditioning task through inhibiting fear to harmless cues.},

Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard `open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Data integration promises to be one of the main catalysts in enabling new insights to be drawn from the wealth of biological data available publicly. However, the heterogeneity of the different data sources, both at the syntactic and the semantic level, still poses significant challenges for achieving interoperability among biological databases.Results: We introduce an ontology-based federated approach for data integration. We applied this approach to three heterogeneous data stores that span different areas of biological knowledge: (i) Bgee, a gene expression relational database; (ii) Orthologous Matrix (OMA), a Hierarchical Data Format 5 orthology DS; and (iii) UniProtKB, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) store containing protein sequence and functional information. To enable federated queries across these sources, we first defined a new semantic model for gene expression called GenEx. We then show how the relational data in Bgee can be expressed as a virtual RDF graph, instantiating GenEx, through dedicated relational-to-RDF mappings. By applying these mappings, Bgee data are now accessible through a public SPARQL endpoint. Similarly, the materialized RDF data of OMA, expressed in terms of the Orthology ontology, is made available in a public SPARQL endpoint. We identified and formally described intersection points (i.e. virtual links) among the three data sources. These allow performing joint queries across the data stores. Finally, we lay the groundwork to enable nontechnical users to benefit from the integrated data, by providing a natural language template-based search interface.},

  abstract = {The acoustic dimensions that distinguish speech sounds (like the vowel differences in "boot" and "boat") also differentiate speakers' voices. Therefore, listeners must normalize across speakers without losing linguistic information. Past behavioral work suggests an important role for auditory contrast enhancement in normalization: preceding context affects listeners' perception of subsequent speech sounds. Here, using intracranial electrocorticography in humans, we investigate whether and how such context effects arise in auditory cortex. Participants identified speech sounds that were preceded by phrases from two different speakers whose voices differed along the same acoustic dimension as target words (the lowest resonance of the vocal tract). In every participant, target vowels evoke a speaker-dependent neural response that is consistent with the listener's perception, and which follows from a contrast enhancement model. Auditory cortex processing thus displays a critical feature of normalization, allowing listeners to extract meaningful content from the voices of diverse speakers.},

  abstract = {The auditory neural code must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require great sensitivity in time and frequency and be effective over the diverse array of sounds present in natural acoustic environments. It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Researchers have long noted speech recognition variability that is not explained by the pure-tone audiogram. Previous work (Souza, Wright, Blackburn, Tatman, \& Gallun, 2015) demonstrated that a small number of listeners with sensorineural hearing loss utilized different types of acoustic cues to identify speechlike stimuli, specifically the extent to which the participant relied upon spectral (or temporal) information for identification. Consistent with recent calls for data rigor and reproducibility, the primary aims of this study were to replicate the pattern of cue use in a larger cohort and to verify stability of the cue profiles over time. Method: Cue-use profiles were measured for adults with sensorineural hearing loss using a syllable identification task consisting of synthetic speechlike stimuli in which spectral and temporal dimensions were manipulated along continua. For the first set, a static spectral shape varied from alveolar to palatal, and a temporal envelope rise time varied from affricate to fricative. For the second set, formant transitions varied from labial to alveolar and a temporal envelope rise time varied from approximant to stop. A discriminant feature analysis was used to determine to what degree spectral and temporal information contributed to stimulus identification. A subset of participants completed a 2nd visit using the same stimuli and procedures. Results: When spectral information was static, most participants were more influenced by spectral than by temporal information. When spectral information was dynamic, participants demonstrated a balanced distribution of cue-use patterns, with nearly equal numbers of individuals influenced by spectral or temporal cues. Individual cue profile was repeatable over a period of several months. Conclusion: In combination with previously published data, these results indicate that listeners with sensorineural hearing loss are influenced by different cues to identify speechlike sounds and that those patterns are stable over time.},

  title = {Speech Sound Training Alters Auditory Processing in Rats},
  pages = {6},
  abstract = {Speech sounds evoke unique neural activity patterns in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of rats. Like humans, rats can easily learn to discriminate between speech sounds. Behavioral discrimination accuracy can be predicted by the neural similarity of the A1 response pattern to pairs of speech sounds. For example, pairs of sounds that evoke very similar A1 activity patterns are difficult for rats to discriminate, while pairs of sounds that evoke very distinct A1 activity patterns are easy for rats to discriminate. Rat models of autism exhibit many of the classic neural and behavioral deficits observed in individuals with autism. Extensive speech discrimination training alters auditory cortex responses in both experimentally na\"ive rats and in rat models of autism. However, in some autism models, training alone is insufficient to reverse neural processing deficits. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) triggers rapid, phasic release of plasticity promoting neuromodulators, which enhances plasticity in the auditory network when delivered with sound presentation. For example, pairing the sounds `rad' and `lad' with VNS increases the A1 response strength to the paired sounds. Ongoing work involves pairing VNS with auditory training in rat models of autism to improve both sound discrimination ability and the neural processing of sounds.},

  abstract = {We analyze a large-scale custom software effort, the Worm Community System (WCS), a collaborative system designed for a geographically dispersed community of geneticists. There were complex challenges in creating this infrastructural tool, ranging from simple lack of resources to complex organizational and intellectual communication failures and tradeoffs. Despite high user satisfaction with the system and interface, and extensive user needs assessment, feedback, and analysis, many users experienced difficulties in signing on and use. The study was conducted during a time of unprecedented growth in the Internet and its utilities (1991\textendash 1994), and many respondents turned to the World Wide Web for their information exchange. Using Bateson's model of levels of learning, we analyze the levels of infrastructural complexity involved in system access and designer-user communication. We analyze the connection between systems development aimed at supporting specific forms of collaborative knowledge work, local organizational transformation, and large-scale infrastructural change.},

  abstract = {Empirical research inevitably includes constructing a data set by processing raw data into a form ready for statistical analysis. Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

Differential perception of consonants such as /d/ and /t/ is categorical in American English, with the boundary generally lying at a VOT of 20-40 ms. This study tests whether previously identified response patterns that differentially reflect VOT are maintained in large-scale population activity within primary auditory cortex (A1) of the awake monkey. Multiunit activity and current source density patterns evoked by the syllables /da/ and /ta/ with variable VOTs are examined. Neural representation is determined by the tonotopic organization. Differential response patterns are restricted to lower best-frequency regions. Response peaks time-locked to both consonant and voicing onsets are observed for syllables with a 40- and 60-ms VOT, whereas syllables with a 0- and 20-ms VOT evoke a single response time-locked only to consonant onset. Duration of aspiration noise is represented in higher best-frequency regions. Representation of VOT and aspiration noise in discrete tonotopic areas of A1 suggest that integration of these phonetic cues occurs in secondary areas of auditory cortex. Findings are consistent with the evolving concept that complex stimuli are encoded by synchronized activity in large-scale neuronal ensembles.},

  abstract = {Centralized biodiversity data aggregation is too often failing societal needs due to pervasive and systemic data quality deficiencies. We argue for a novel approach that embodies the spirit of the Web (``small pieces loosely joined'') through the decentralized coordination of data across scientific languages and communities. The upfront cost of decentralization can be offset by the long-term benefit of achieving sustained expert engagement, higher-quality data products, and ultimately more societal impact for biodiversity data. Our decentralized approach encourages the emergence and evolution of multiple self-identifying communities of practice that are regionally, taxonomically, or institutionally localized. Each community is empowered to control the social and informational design and versioning of their local data infrastructures and signals. With no single aggregator to exert centralized control over biodiversity data, decentralization generates loosely connected networks of mid-level aggregators. Global coordination is nevertheless feasible through automatable data sharing agreements that enable efficient propagation and translation of biodiversity data across communities. The decentralized model also poses novel integration challenges, among which the explicit and continuous articulation of conflicting systematic classifications and phylogenies remain the most challenging. We discuss the development of available solutions, challenges, and outline next steps: the global effort of coordination should focus on developing shared languages for data signal translation, as opposed to homogenizing the data signal itself.},

There are potentially two such discontinuities for each consonant, corresponding to the formation and release of a constriction in the oral cavity by the lips, the tongue blade, or the tongue body. Acoustic cues for the various consonant features of place, voicing and nasality reside in the signal in quite different forms on the two sides of each acoustic discontinuity. Examples of these diverse cues and their origin in acoustic theory are reviewed, with special attention to place features and features related to the laryngeal state and to nasalization. A listener appears to have the ability to integrate these diverse, brief acoustic cues for the features of consonants, although the mechanism for this integration process is unclear.},

We have found tendencies of quantal aspects of temporal structure, superimposed on more gradual variations, which add quasi-rhythmical elements to speech. A local average of inter-stress intervals of the order of 0.5 sec. appears to function as a reference quantum for the planning of pause durations. A recent study, confirming our previous findings of multiple peaks with about 0.5 sec. spacing in histograms of pause durations, provides support for this model. It is well established that pause durations tend to increase with increasing syntactic level of boundaries. However, these variations tend to be quantally scaled, even within a specific boundary category, e.g. between sentences or between paragraphs. Relatively short pauses, as between phrases or clauses, show durations in complementary relation to terminal lengthening. There are indications of approximately 1, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 ratios of the average durations of inter-stress intervals, stressed syllables, unstressed syllables and phoneme segments, which add to the observed regularities. The timing of syllables and phonetic segments, with due regard to relative distinctiveness and reading speed, is discussed, and also tempo variations within a sentence},

Effective distributed cyberinfrastructure, in turn, supports science and engineering applications. The purpose of this study was to understand what factors lead to software projects being well sustained over the long run, focusing on software created with funding from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and/or used by researchers funded by the NSF. We surveyed NSF-funded researchers and performed in-depth studies of software projects that have been sustained over many years. Successful projects generally used open-source software licenses and employed good software engineering practices and test practices. However, many projects that have not been well sustained over time also met these criteria. The features that stood out about successful projects included deeply committed leadership and some sort of user forum or conference at least annually. In some cases, software project leaders have employed multiple financial strategies over the course of a decades-old software project. Such well-sustained software is used in major distributed CI projects that support thousands of users, and this software is critical to the operation of major distributed CI facilities in the US. The findings of our study identify some characteristics of software that is relevant to the NSF-supported research community, and that has been sustained over many years.},

Stilp and colleagues recently reported efficient coding of robust correlation (r = .97) among complex acoustic attributes (attack/decay, spectral shape) in novel sounds. Discrimination of sounds orthogonal to the correlation was initially inferior but later comparable to that of sounds obeying the correlation. These effects were attenuated for less-correlated stimuli (r = .54) for reasons that are unclear. Here, statistical properties of correlation among acoustic attributes essential for perceptual organization are investigated. Overall, simple strength of the principal correlation is inadequate to predict listener performance. Initial superiority of discrimination for statistically consistent sound pairs was relatively insensitive to decreased physical acoustic/psychoacoustic range of evidence supporting the correlation, and to more frequent presentations of the same orthogonal test pairs. However, increased range supporting an orthogonal dimension has substantial effects upon perceptual organization. Connectionist simulations and Eigenvalues from closed-form calculations of principal components analysis (PCA) reveal that perceptual organization is near-optimally weighted to shared versus unshared covariance in experienced sound distributions. Implications of reduced perceptual dimensionality for speech perception and plausible neural substrates are discussed.},

RESULTS: 47 potential statistical errors and shortcomings, differentiated for the distinct phases of medical research are presented and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Statisticians should be involved early in study design, as mistakes at this point can have major repercussions, negatively affecting all subsequent stages of medical research. Consideration of issues discussed in this paper, when planning, conducting and preparing medical research manuscripts, should help further enhance statistical quality in medical journals.},

  abstract = {Neuroethological investigations of mammalian and avian auditory systems have documented species-specific specializations for processing complex acoustic signals that could, if viewed in abstract terms, have an intriguing and striking relevance for human speech sound categorization and representation. Each species forms biologically relevant categories based on combinatorial analysis of information-bearing parameters within the complex input signal. This target article uses known neural models from the mustached bat and barn owl to develop, by analogy, a conceptualization of human processing of consonant plus vowel sequences that offers a partial solution to the noninvariance dilemma--the nontransparent relationship between the acoustic waveform and the phonetic segment. Critical input sound parameters used to establish species-specific categories in the mustached bat and barn owl exhibit high correlation and linearity due to physical laws. A cue long known to be relevant to the perception of stop place of articulation is the second formant (F2) transition. This article describes an empirical phenomenon--the locus equations--that describes the relationship between the F2 of a vowel and the F2 measured at the onset of a consonant-vowel (CV) transition. These variables, F2 onset and F2 vowel within a given place category, are consistently and robustly linearly correlated across diverse speakers and languages, and even under perturbation conditions as imposed by bite blocks. A functional role for this category-level extreme correlation and linearity (the "orderly output constraint") is hypothesized based on the notion of an evolutionarily conserved auditory-processing strategy. High correlation and linearity between critical parameters in the speech signal that help to cue place of articulation categories might have evolved to satisfy a preadaptation by mammalian auditory systems for representing tightly correlated, linearly related components of acoustic signals.},

  abstract = {Gap detection threshold (GDT) was measured in adult female pigmented rats (strain Long\textendash Evans) by an operant conditioning technique with food reinforcement, before and after bilateral ablation of the auditory cortex. GDT was dependent on the frequency spectrum and intensity of the continuously present noise in which the gaps were embedded. The mean values of GDT for gaps embedded in white noise or low-frequency noise (upper cutoff frequency 3 kHz) at 70 dB sound pressure level (SPL) were 1.57{$\pm$}0.07 ms and 2.9{$\pm$}0.34 ms, respectively. Decreasing noise intensity from 80 dB SPL to 20 dB SPL produced a significant increase in GDT. The increase in GDT was relatively small in the range of 80\textendash 50 dB SPL for white noise and in the range of 80\textendash 60 dB for low-frequency noise. The minimal intensity level of the noise that enabled GDT measurement was 20 dB SPL for white noise and 30 dB SPL for low-frequency noise. Mean GDT values at these intensities were 10.6{$\pm$}3.9 ms and 31.3{$\pm$}4.2 ms, respectively. Bilateral ablation of the primary auditory cortex (complete destruction of the Te1 and partial destruction of the Te2 and Te3 areas) resulted in an increase in GDT values. The fifth day after surgery, the rats were able to detect gaps in the noise. The values of GDT observed at this time were 4.2{$\pm$}1.1 ms for white noise and 7.4{$\pm$}3.1 ms for low-frequency noise at 70 dB SPL. During the first month after cortical ablation, recovery of GDT was observed. However, 1 month after cortical ablation GDT still remained slightly higher than in controls (1.8{$\pm$}0.18 for white noise, 3.22{$\pm$}0.15 for low-frequency noise, P{$<$}0.05). A decrease in GDT values during the subsequent months was not observed.},

The consonants studied are /{$\partial$} z z d g n n l r/. Comparisons between EPG and LE data suggest that the LE analysis provides an accurate reflection of the degree of coarticulation for the stop and nasal classes in English, which have an alveolar and a velar place of articulation amongst the lingual consonants. By contrast, the correlation between EPG and LE data for the fricative consonants is very poor. Two explanations are offered for the poorer results for the fricatives: (1) the fricative noise following consonant release obscures the F 2 transition, rendering formant measurement less accurate, and (2) the LE is capable of encoding gross differences in degree of coarticulation (such as that between an alveolar and a velar) but not more subtle differences such as those between the various coronal articulations.},

  abstract = {Cortical reorganizations during acquisition of motor skills and experience-dependent recovery after deafferentation consist of several distinct phases, in which expansion of receptive fields is followed by the shrinkage and use-dependent refinement. In perceptual learning, however, such non-monotonic, stage-dependent plasticity remains elusive in the sensory cortex. In the present study, microelectrode mapping characterized plasticity in the rat auditory cortex, including primary, anterior, and ventral/suprarhinal auditory fields (A1, AAF, and VAF/SRAF), at the early and late stages of appetitive operant conditioning. We first demonstrate that most plasticity at the early stage was tentative, and that long-lasting plasticity after extended training was able to be categorized into either early- or late-stage-dominant plasticity. Second, training-induced plasticity occurred both locally and globally with a specific temporal order. Conditioned-stimulus (CS) frequency used in the task tended to be locally over-represented in AAF at the early stage and in VAF/SRAF at the late stage. The behavioral relevance of neural responses suggests that the local plasticity also occurred in A1 at the early stage. In parallel, the tone-responsive area globally shrank at the late stage independently of CS frequency, and this shrinkage was also correlated with the behavioral improvements. Thus, the stage-dependent plasticity may commonly underlie cortical reorganization in the perceptual learning, yet the interactions of local and global plasticity have led to more complicated reorganization than previously thought. Field-specific plasticity has important implications for how each field subserves in the learning; for example, consistent with recent notions, A1 should construct filters to better identify auditory objects at the early stage, while VAF/SRAF contribute to hierarchical computation and storage at the late stage.},

There are four tools most commonly used to calculate the h-index, all of which depend on separate databases: Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate. Using the h-index of the authors of this paper derived from these four sources, it is abundantly clear that scores vary widely and that it is unclear which of these sources is a reliable or accurate source of information, for any purpose. As the use and application of author-based metrics increases, including for official academic purposes, it is becoming increasingly important to know which source of the h-index is most accurate, and thus valid. Although this is not a review of the h-index, some perspectives are provided of the h-index-related literature to place this case study within a wider context of the weaknesses and criticisms of using the h-index as a metric to evaluate scientific outcome.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychological research, the field of language neurobiology is at a cross-roads with respect to its framing theories. The central thesis of this article is that the major historical framing model, the Classic ``Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind'' model, and associated terminology, is no longer adequate for contemporary investigations into the neurobiology of language. We argue that the Classic model (1) is based on an outdated brain anatomy; (2) does not adequately represent the distributed connectivity relevant for language, (3) offers a modular and ``language centric'' perspective, and (4) focuses on cortical structures, for the most part leaving out subcortical regions and relevant connections. To make our case, we discuss the issue of anatomical specificity with a focus on the contemporary usage of the terms ``Broca's and Wernicke's area'', including results of a survey that was conducted within the language neurobiology community. We demonstrate that there is no consistent anatomical definition of ``Broca's and Wernicke's Areas'', and propose to replace these terms with more precise anatomical definitions. We illustrate the distributed nature of the language connectome, which extends far beyond the single-pathway notion of arcuate fasciculus connectivity established in Geschwind's version of the Classic Model. By illustrating the definitional confusion surrounding ``Broca's and Wernicke's areas'', and by illustrating the difficulty integrating the emerging literature on perisylvian white matter connectivity into this model, we hope to expose the limits of the model, argue for its obsolescence, and suggest a path forward in defining a replacement.},

We revise fifteen years of research on decentralization and privacy, and provide an overview of key systems, as well as key insights for designers of future systems. We show that decentralized designs can enhance privacy, integrity, and availability but also require careful trade-offs in terms of system complexity, properties provided, and degree of decentralization. These trade-offs need to be understood and navigated by designers. We argue that a combination of insights from cryptography, distributed systems, and mechanism design, aligned with the development of adequate incentives, are necessary to build scalable and successful privacy-preserving decentralized systems.},

  abstract = {The metric and dimensional assumptions that underlie the geometric represen-tation of similarity are questioned on both theoretical and empirical grounds. A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features, and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and differ-ence, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representa-tions of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance. Similarity plays a fundamental role in errors of substitution, and correlation between theories of knowledge and behavior. It serves occurrences.

A series of studies of 2-dimensional stimuli with separable attributes (including house plants, parallelograms, schematic faces, and histograms), using judgments of similarity and dissimilarity, classification, inference, and recognition errors, all support the coincidence hypothesis. The size of the effect is determined by the separability of the stimuli, the transparency of the dimensional structure, and the discriminability of the levels within each dimension. Applications of the coincidence effect to inductive inference are investigated, and its relations to selective attention and spatial density are discussed. It is concluded that the triangle inequality and segmental additivity cannot be jointly satisfied for separable attributes. The implications of this result for multidimensional scaling are discussed.

  abstract = {Any event in the history of the organism is, in a sense, unique. Consequently, recognition, learning, and judgment presuppose an ability to categorize stimuli and classify situations by similarity . As Quine (1969) puts it: \&quot;There is nothing more basic to thought and language than our sense of similarity ; our sorting of things into kinds [p . 1161 .\&quot; Indeed, the notion of similarity that appears under such different names as proximity, resemblance, communality, representativeness, and psychological distance is fundamental to theories of perception, learning, and judgment . This chapter outlines a new theoretical analysis of similarity and investigates some of its empirical consequences . The theoretical analysis of similarity relations has been dominated by geometric models. Such models represent each object as a point in some coordinate space so that the metric distances between the points reflect the observed similarities between the respective objects . In general, the space is assumed to be Euclidean, and the purpose of the analysis is to embed the objects in a space of minimum dimensionality on the basis of the observed similarities, see Shepard (1974) . In a recent paper (Tversky, 1977), the first author challenged the dimensionalmetric assumptions that underlie the geometric approach to similarity and developed an alternative feature-theoretical approach to the analysis of similarity relations. In this approach, each object a is characterized by a set of features, denoted A, and the observed similarity of a to b, denoted s(a, b), is expressed as a function of their common and distinctive features (see Fig . 4.1) . That is, the observed similarity s(a, b) is expressed as a function of three arguments : A f1B, the features shared by a and b ;A B, the features of a that are not shared by b ; B A, the features of b that are not shared by a . Thus the similarity between},

Herein, this study aimed to investigate whether telomere length, a biological indicator of age-related diseases, is associated with ATDILI outcomes and could serve as an early ATDILI biomarker. Relative telomere length (RTL) in blood leukocyte of 100 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, 49 tuberculosis patients with ATDILI, and 53 tuberculosis patients with non-ATDILI was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both tuberculosis patients with and without ATDILI had significantly shorter RTL than healthy controls. Compared with tuberculosis patients with non-ATDILI, RTL in those with ATDILI was significantly increased. Longer RTL was found to be significantly associated with increased susceptibility to ATDILI. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that an increment in RTL was independently correlated with elevated values of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase assessed within 60 days after anti-tuberculosis treatment. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that longer RTL was associated with elevated rates of hepatotoxicity in tuberculosis patients. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis unveiled a diagnostic accuracy of RTL as a novel indicator for ATDILI progression (AUC\,=\,0.73), which yielded more sensitive and specific values than traditional liver biomarkers including serum enzyme activities of aminotransferases measured within 7 days after treatment with anti-tuberculosis regimens. Collectively, aberrant RTL in blood leukocyte would reflect hepatotoxicity induced by anti-tuberculosis agents and might have a potential biomarker for early ATDILI progression.},

  abstract = {Within clinical, biomedical, and translational science, an increasing number of projects are adopting graphs for knowledge representation. Graph-based data models elucidate the interconnectedness among core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these ``knowledge graphs'' (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally accepted, open-access model for standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open-source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates) representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomic structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science.},

  abstract = {Based on a rigorous analysis of existing workflow management systems and workflow languages, a new workflow language is proposed: yet another workflow language (YAWL). To identify the differences between the various languages, we have collected a fairly complete set of workflow patterns. Based on these patterns we have evaluated several workflow products and detected considerable differences in their ability to capture control flows for non-trivial workflow processes. Languages based on Petri nets perform better when it comes to state-based workflow patterns. However, some patterns (e.g. involving multiple instances, complex synchronisations or non-local withdrawals) are not easy to map onto (high-level) Petri nets. This inspired us to develop a new language by taking Petri nets as a starting point and adding mechanisms to allow for a more direct and intuitive support of the workflow patterns identified. This paper motivates the need for such a language, specifies the semantics of the language, and shows that soundness can be verified in a compositional way. Although YAWL is intended as a complete workflow language, the focus of this paper is limited to the control-flow perspective.},

  abstract = {Does exposure to news affect what people know about politics? This old question attracted new scholarly interest as the political information environment is changing rapidly. In particular, since citizens have new channels at their disposal, such as Twitter and Facebook, which increasingly complement or even replace traditional channels of information. This study investigates to what extent citizens have knowledge about daily politics and to what extent news on social media can provide this knowledge. It does so by means of a large online survey in Belgium (Flanders), in which we measured what people know about current political events, their so-called general surveillance knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that unlike following news via traditional media channels, citizens do not gain more political knowledge from following news on social media. We even find a negative association between following the news on Facebook and political knowledge. We further investigate why this is the case. Our data demonstrate that this lack of learning on social media is not due to a narrow, personalized news diet, as is often suggested. Rather, we find evidence that following news via social media increases a feeling of information overload, which decreases what people actually learn, especially for citizens who combine news via social media with other news sources.},

We then show how theoretical analyses can endow a theory with minimal plausibility even before contact with empirical data: We call this the theoretical cycle. Finally, we explain how our proposal may contribute to addressing critical issues in psychological science, including how to leverage effects to understand capacities better.},

  abstract = {This small book owes its existence in large part to Jean Strouse. Late in 2003, when she was still the freshly appointed director of The New York Public Library's Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers, Jean asked me to give a series of three lectures the following fall, an annual event sponsored by W. W. Norton \& Company, hoping that I would speak about some aspects of the relationship between the sciences and the humanities. This notion was inspired, in part, by her long-range goal of using her new position to promote a greater interest in and knowledge about science among her colleagues in the humanities. I was asked because she knew that I had studied literature in earlier years and continue to read widely in realms beyond the science that I practice. At first, she suggested that I revisit the concept of two cultures, which is generally traced to the 1959 Rede Lecture delivered by C. P. Snow, who had achieved prominence as a scientist, a novelist, and a government official. Snow's description of the two cultures, the arts and the sciences, separated by a gulf of language and thought, met with both hearty acclaim and strident criticism, and the subsequent debates attracted enormous attention. (I recall an evening given over to an American version of the debate at a fraternity house at Amherst College in 1960, when I was an undergraduate there.) But on rereading both the original lecture and Snow's responses to his critics, I found (and Jean did too) that the idea of two cultures now appeared too simplistic, however accurate, to bear a lengthy reexamination. So, after a series of lunches and email exchanges, we agreed that I would endeavor to explain what it means to be a scientist\textemdash or, anyhow, what it has meant for me to be a scientist. That seemed to be a way to fulfill at least part of her original purpose, since I came to science through an education in the humanities, and my career as a scientist has included significant forays into politics, administration, publishing, and international issues. By defining my purpose in this manner, I hoped to make some aspects of the life and thoughts of one scientist intelligible and possibly interesting to even the most entrenched members of the ``other'' culture. To do this, I intended to use my three lectures to describe three things: first, how I became a scientist; then, something about the work my colleagues and I have done and its significance for the control of cancer; and, finally, examples of my experience in government and policy-making, to offer a view of a scientist in a larger world that includes politics and the arts. The assignment encouraged me to think more than I would otherwise have done about the shape of my career, which revealed to me how meandering and unexpected it has been. This theme\textemdash with implicit course changes and serendipities\textemdash became a dominant one in the lectures and even more so in this volume.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Shifting our perspective back to the point of production suggests that digital artifacts are embedded in a broader data economy.

We contrast our findings with an earlier study [11] and present three main results. First, the community maintains a strong resilience to malicious editing, despite tremendous growth and high traffic. Second, the fastest growing areas of Wikipedia are devoted to coordination and organization. Finally, we focus on a particular set of pages used to coordinate work, the ``Talk'' pages. By manually coding the content of a subset of these pages, we find that these pages serve many purposes, notably supporting strategic planning of edits and enforcement of standard guidelines and conventions. Our results suggest that despite the potential for anarchy, the Wikipedia community places a strong emphasis on group coordination, policy, and process.},

How do people overcome the curse of dimensionality when acquiring real-world categories that have many different features? Here we investigate the possibility that the structure of categories can help. We show that when categories follow a family resemblance structure, people are unaffected by the presence of additional features in learning. However, when categories are based on a single feature, they fall prey to the curse and having additional irrelevant features hurts performance. We compare and contrast these results to three different computational models to show that a model with limited computational capacity best captures human performance across almost all of the conditions in both experiments.},

Similarly, an animal must be able to recognize a warning call whether the caller has a high-pitched female or a lower-pitched male voice, and whether they are sitting in a tree to the left or right. This type of perceptual invariance to "nuisance" parameters comes easily to listeners, but it is unknown whether or how such robust representations of sounds are formed at the level of sensory cortex. In this study, we investigate whether neurons in both core and belt areas of ferret auditory cortex can robustly represent the pitch, formant frequencies, or azimuthal location of artificial vowel sounds while the other two attributes vary. We found that the spike rates of the majority of cortical neurons that are driven by artificial vowels carry robust representations of these features, but the most informative temporal response windows differ from neuron to neuron and across five auditory cortical fields. Furthermore, individual neurons can represent multiple features of sounds unambiguously by independently modulating their spike rates within distinct time windows. Such multiplexing may be critical to identifying sounds that vary along more than one perceptual dimension. Finally, we observed that formant information is encoded in cortex earlier than pitch information, and we show that this time course matches ferrets' behavioral reaction time differences on a change detection task.},

The number of action potentials evoked by each stimulus usually does not increase with increasing stimulus duration. Such observations have long puzzled researchers across disciplines and raised serious questions regarding the role of the auditory cortex in encoding ongoing acoustic signals. Contrary to these long-held views, here we show that single neurons in both primary (area A1) and lateral belt areas of the auditory cortex of awake marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) are capable of firing in a sustained manner over a prolonged period of time, especially when they are driven by their preferred stimuli. In contrast, responses become more transient or phasic when auditory cortex neurons respond to non-preferred stimuli. These findings suggest that when the auditory cortex is stimulated by a sound, a particular population of neurons fire maximally throughout the duration of the sound. Responses of other, less optimally driven neurons fade away quickly after stimulus onset. This results in a selective representation of the sound across both neuronal population and time.},

This unique organization reflects the needs of the auditory system to extract behaviorally relevant information from a complex acoustic environment using strategies different from those used by other sensory systems. The neural representations of acoustic information in auditory cortex can be characterized by three types: (1) isomorphic (faithful) representations of acoustic structures; (2) non-isomorphic transformations of acoustic features and (3) transformations from acoustical to perceptual dimensions. The challenge facing auditory neurophysiologists is to understand the nature of the latter two transformations. In this article, I will review recent studies from our laboratory regarding temporal discharge patterns in auditory cortex of awake marmosets and cortical representations of time-varying signals. Findings from these studies show that (1) firing patterns of neurons in auditory cortex are dependent on stimulus optimality and context and (2) the auditory cortex forms internal representations of sounds that are no longer faithful replicas of their acoustic structures.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Human sensorimotor decision-making has a tendency to get `stuck in a rut', being biased towards selecting a previously implemented action structure (`hysteresis'). Existing explanations cannot provide a principled account of when hysteresis will occur. We propose that hysteresis is an emergent property of a dynamical system learning from the consequences of its actions. To examine this, 152 participants moved a cursor to a target on a tablet device whilst avoiding an obstacle. Hysteresis was observed when the obstacle moved sequentially across the screen between trials, but not with random obstacle placement. Two further experiments (n = 20) showed an attenuation when time and resource constraints were eased. We created a simple computational model capturing dynamic probabilistic estimate updating that showed the same patterns of results. This provides the first computational demonstration of how sensorimotor decision-making can get `stuck in a rut' through the dynamic updating of its probability estimates.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Significance Statement{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Humans show a bias to select the organisational structure of a recently carried out action, even when an alternative option is available with lower costs. This `hysteresis' is said to be more efficient than creating a new plan and it has been interpreted as a `design feature' within decision-making systems. We suggest such teleological arguments are redundant, with hysteresis being a naturally emergent property of a dynamic control system that evolved to operate effectively in an uncertain and partially observable world. Empirical experimentation and simulations from a `first principle' computational model of decision-making were consistent with our hypothesis. The identification of such a mechanism can inform robotics research, suggesting how robotic agents can show human-like flexibility in complex dynamic environments.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

It remains unclear why auditory cortex should be necessary for some auditory tasks but not others. One possibility is that auditory cortex is causally involved in gap detection and other forms of temporal processing in order to associate meaning with temporally structured sounds. This predicts that auditory cortex should be necessary for associating meaning with gaps. To test this prediction, we developed a fear conditioning paradigm for mice based on gap detection. We found that pairing a 10 or 100 ms gap with an aversive stimulus caused a robust enhancement of gap detection measured 6 h later, which we refer to as fear potentiation of gap detection. Optogenetic suppression of auditory cortex during pairing abolished this fear potentiation, indicating that auditory cortex is critically involved in associating temporally structured sounds with emotionally salient events.},

  abstract = {In the wild, animals are exposed to an ever-changing array of sensory stimuli. The captive environment, by contrast, is generally much more impoverished in terms of the sensory cues it offers the animals housed within. In a bid to remedy this, and promote better welfare, researchers have started to explore the merits of sensory stimulation (i.e. stimulation designed to trigger one or more of an animal's senses) as a potential method of environmental enrichment for captive animals. This paper reviews the research in this area, focusing specifically on auditory, olfactory and visual methods of sensory stimulation. Studies exploring the efficacy of each type of stimulation as an enrichment tool are described, where appropriate, making a distinction between those that occur in the animal's natural habitat, and those that do not. Overall, it is concluded that sensory stimulation harbours enrichment potential for some animals housed in institutional settings, although the specific merits gained from these enrichments are likely to depend upon a wide variety of factors including, for example, species, sex, age and housing conditions. Programmes of sensory enrichment that target the dominant sense for the species under scrutiny, using harmless, non-stressful stimuli, are likely to result in the greatest benefits for animal welfare. Stimuli specific to a species' natural habitat should not always be considered meaningful, or advantageous, to an animal's welfare; in some cases stimuli that do not occur naturally in the wild (e.g. classical music) may offer more in the way of welfare advantages. Shortcomings in the research, and factors to consider when implementing enrichment of this nature, are discussed throughout.},

  abstract = {This article provides a history of private sector tracking technologies, examining how the advent of commercial surveillance centered around a logic of data capitalism. Data capitalism is a system in which the commoditization of our data enables an asymmetric redistribution of power that is weighted toward the actors who have access and the capability to make sense of information. It is enacted through capitalism and justified by the association of networked technologies with the political and social benefits of online community, drawing upon narratives that foreground the social and political benefits of networked technologies. I examine its origins in the wake of the dotcom bubble, when technology makers sought to develop a new business model to support online commerce. By leveraging user data for advertising purposes, they contributed to an information environment in which every action leaves behind traces collected by companies for commercial purposes. Through analysis of primary source materials produced by technology makers, journalists, and business analysts, I examine the emergence of data capitalism between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s and its central role in the contemporary information economy.},

Flow can replace the current Wikipedia talk page system and intends to provide certain features that are present on some other popular websites, but which are not easy to implement in wikitext.  For example, Flow automatically signs posts, threads replies, and permits per-topic notifications. With wikitext a bot is used to automatically sign posts that are unsigned. Flow also results in the loss of certain features within wikitext, such as the ability to use the "history" tab to view all comments since one looked at the talk page last, and the ability to easily portray article content on talk pages. The main goals for the Flow project are to make the wiki discussion system more accessible for new users. to make the wiki discussion system more efficient for experienced users. to encourage meaningful conversations that support collaboration.Flow is currently deployed on several talk pages on Mediawiki.org and on various language Wikipedias. Flow was uninstalled from English Wikipedia in November 2016, by request from the community. You might encounter it on other Wikimedia wikis however. There are currently no plans for it to return to English Wikipedia.},

To give the award to someone, just place the image on their talk page, and explain why it was given. If you are sure the barnstar is appropriate, don't be shy! The barnstar is not unique to Wikipedia. Some years ago, some wiki-based communities began to give their users awards called barn stars, using a star anchor to represent the concept of the shared work experience, as in barn raising. See Barnstar for more background about the word. The concept of the barnstar as a Wiki award was created by SunirShah on MeatballWiki.   Web designers were invited to incorporate a similar barn star design into their project as Easter eggs.Wiki barnstars were introduced to Wikipedia in December 2003 by MartinHarper. Since then, the concept has become ingrained in the Wikipedia culture. These awards are part of the Kindness Campaign and are meant to promote civility and WikiLove. They are a form of warm fuzzy: they are free to give and they bring joy to the recipient. While awarding a barnstar, remember to provide relevant text as to why you are awarding it. The following are some of the barnstars and awards currently in use. If you don't feel any of these covers the topics you are concerned with, you can always design your own award (using these examples, if you like). If you have questions, WikiProject Wikipedia Awards is a group of volunteers who help guide these pages. There are many types of barnstars. Please make sure that your choice is fair and appropriate, which will help prevent over-use. Remember that there are other ways of showing simple appreciation to someone, such as a comment on the user's talk page, a "thank" notification from an article's history page, and alternative awards such as cookies in Personal user awards.},

  abstract = {Summary Complex animal behaviors are likely built from simpler modules, but their systematic identification in mammals remains a significant challenge. Here we use depth imaging to show that 3D mouse pose dynamics are structured at the sub-second timescale. Computational modeling of these fast dynamics effectively describes mouse behavior as a series of reused and stereotyped modules with defined transition probabilities. We demonstrate this combined 3D imaging and machine learning method can be used to unmask potential strategies employed by the brain to adapt to the environment, to capture both predicted and previously hidden phenotypes caused by genetic or neural manipulations, and to systematically expose the global structure of behavior within an experiment. This work reveals that mouse body language is built from identifiable components and is organized in a predictable fashion; deciphering this language establishes an objective framework for characterizing the influence of environmental cues, genes and neural activity on behavior.

Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) is an ethologically inspired behavioral analysis method that identifies modular components of three-dimensional mouse body language called `syllables'. Here, we show that MoSeq effectively parses behavioral differences and captures similarities elicited by a panel of neuroactive and psychoactive drugs administered to a cohort of nearly 700 mice. MoSeq identifies syllables that are characteristic of individual drugs, a finding we leverage to reveal specific on- and off-target effects of both established and candidate therapeutics in a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder. These results demonstrate that MoSeq can meaningfully organize large-scale behavioral data, illustrate the power of a fundamentally modular description of behavior and suggest that behavioral syllables represent a new class of druggable target.},

However, existing efforts to integrate a diversity of data sources have been limited to only a small selection of data types, typically gene expression data, drug structural information, and protein interaction networks. In this study, we leverage a graph-based approach to integrate biological knowledge from 20 publicly accessible repositories to represent information involving 11 distinct bioentity types. We then employ a graph node embedding scheme and use utilize a random forest model to make novel predictions about which drugs can be used to treat certain diseases. Utilizing this approach, we find a performance improvement over existing computational drug repurposing approaches and find promising drug repositioning targets, including drug and disease pairs currently in clinical trials.},

The rate of increase for institutions selecting systems for finance and human capital more than doubled in 2020 compared to the previous year, the group found. And as a growing number of higher education institutions make long-term decisions for their technology infrastructures, the landscape also grows more homogeneous: Researchers found that among those that made decisions for those systems in 2020, more than 90\% selected cloud solutions, rather than buying technology to continue hosting services in their local environments.

  abstract = {IntroductionMuch recent work in phonological theory has highlighted the role that perception plays in phonological processes. The perceptual basis of contrasts and features has been explored by Flemming (1995/2002), Gordon (1999), and Kirchner (1997) among others. Other work has highlighted the role that perception can play in motivating constraints. In this approach, phonological processes such as positional neutralisation, gemination, and assimilation are motivated by interactions between the strength of perceptual cues and some notion of articulatory ease (Jun 1995; Kirchner 2000; Silverman 1997; Steriade 1995). While some would argue that permitting perceptually motivated constraints to play a role in phonological grammar introduces a prohibitive level of complexity into analyses, the (re)introduction of functionally motivated constraints permits the unification of previously disparate analyses, and in the work cited above it has reduced the number of ad hoc stipulations and exceptions necessary to capture the pattern.The time seems ripe to revise one of the most widely used, and yet one of the most problematic, constraints in phonological theory: the Sonority Sequencing Constraint. It is almost universally recognised that the Sonority Sequencing Constraint is plagued with exceptions (see Clements 1990 for discussion) and yet most of the efforts to reform it have ended in stipulative patches rather than real improvement. The lack of success in reformulating the Sonority Sequencing Constraint stems at least in part from its greatest flaw: it lacks an explicit, unified phonetic characterisation. Previous efforts at motivating the Sonority Sequencing Constraint on typological grounds have been criticised for their lack of explanatory power and can be seen as circular in their reasoning.},

  abstract = {Frequency preference and spectral tuning are two cardinal features of information processing in the auditory cortex. However, sounds should not only be processed in separate frequency bands because information needs to be integrated to be meaningful. One way to better understand the integration of acoustic information is to examine the functional connectivity across cortical depths, as neurons are already connected differently across laminar layers. Using a tailored receiver array and surface-based cortical depth analysis, we revealed the frequency\textendash preference as well as tuning\textendash width dependent intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) across cortical depths in the human auditory cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We demonstrated feature-dependent iFC in both core and noncore regions at all cortical depths. The selectivity of frequency\textendash preference dependent iFC was higher at deeper depths than at intermediate and superficial depths in the core region. Both the selectivity of frequency\textendash preference and tuning\textendash width dependent iFC were stronger in the core than in the noncore region at deep cortical depths. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for a cortical depth-specific feature-dependent functional connectivity in the human auditory cortex.},

In the present study, we characterized sources of local input to nine distinct types of layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons in living slices of mouse somatosensory cortex. Whole-cell recordings from identified cell types, facilitated by use of transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein in limited inhibitory neuron populations, were combined with laser scanning photostimulation. We found that each inhibitory cell type received distinct excitatory and inhibitory laminar input patterns. Excitatory inputs could be grouped into three categories. All inhibitory cell types received strong excitation from layer 2/3, and for calretinin (CR)-positive Martinotti cells and burst-spiking interneurons, this was their dominant source of excitatory input. Three other cell types, including fast-spiking basket cells, CR-negative Martinotti cells, and bipolar interneurons, also received strong excitatory input from layer 4. The remaining four inhibitory cell types, including chandelier cells, neurogliaform cells, irregular spiking basket cells, and regular spiking presumptive basket cells, received strong excitatory input from layer 5A and not layer 4. Laminar sources of inhibitory input varied between cell types and could not be predicted from the sources of excitatory input. Thus, there are cell-type specific differences in laminar sources of both excitation and inhibition, and complementary input patterns from layer 4 versus layer 5A suggest cell type differences in their relationships to lemniscal versus paralemniscal pathways.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}ABSTRACT{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Over the last decade, artificial neural networks (ANNs), have undergone a revolution, catalyzed in large part by better tools for supervised learning. However, training such networks requires enormous data sets of labeled examples, whereas young animals (including humans) typically learn with few or no labeled examples. This stark contrast with biological learning has led many in the ANN community posit that instead of supervised paradigms, animals must rely instead primarily on unsupervised learning, leading the search for better unsupervised algorithms. Here we argue that much of an animal's behavioral repertoire is not the result of clever learning algorithms\textemdash supervised or unsupervised\textemdash but arises instead from behavior programs already present at birth. These programs arise through evolution, are encoded in the genome, and emerge as a consequence of wiring up the brain. Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them learn very rapidly. Recognizing the importance of the highly structured connectivity suggests a path toward building ANNs capable of rapid learning.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Despite its importance, both in terms of its footprint in the Internet and the influence it has on emerging P2P applications, the BitTorrent Ecosystem is only partially understood. We seek to provide a nearly complete picture of the entire public BitTorrent Ecosystem. To this end, we crawl five of the most popular torrent-discovery sites over a ine-month period, identifying all of 4.6 million and 38,996 trackers that the sites reference. We also develop a high-performance tracker crawler, and over a narrow window of 12 hours, crawl essentially all of the public Ecosystem's trackers, obtaining peer lists for all referenced torrents. Complementing the torrent-discovery site and tracker crawling, we further crawl Azureus and Mainline DHTs for a random sample of torrents. Our resulting measurement data are more than an order of magnitude larger (in terms of number of torrents, trackers, or peers) than any earlier study. Using this extensive data set, we study in-depth the Ecosystem's torrent-discovery, tracker, peer, user behavior, and content landscapes. For peer statistics, the analysis is based on one typical snapshot obtained over 12 hours. We further analyze the fragility of the Ecosystem upon the removal of its most important tracker service.},

  abstract = {This article describes an emergent logic of accumulation in the networked sphere, `surveillance capitalism,' and considers its implications for `information civilization.' The institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: `data extraction and analysis,' `new contractual forms due to better monitoring,' `personalization and customization,' and `continuous experiments.' An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: `Big Other.' It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},
