\textit{This dissertation would not have been possible without the love and support of many people.}

\textit{I would like to thank my parents for tolerating me for so many years, I've finally found a way to take all the angst and DMCA shutoffs and bricked computers and go pro.}

\textit{Thank you as well to my undergraduate mentor Emma Coddington who was willing to take me into her lab on a last-hour discovery of purpose and made it possible for me to be a part of science at all. Thanks to a few others from those years: Bill Duvall for teaching me the power of knowing the contingency of history, Steve Heller for being a model of navigating empowerment and profit in science, and a few friends who made it through those messy years with me and I hope to see again soon.}

\textit{I remember arriving late, underdressed, underslept, and with a headful of nonsense ideas to my initial interview to work with Mike Wehr, I am forever grateful for him for taking a risk on me despite my having absolutely no business being here. Not much has changed, and it has been a lovely, tumultuous ride as Mike supported me through a kaleideskope of projects that only occasionally made sense, giving me the space to chase the tail of whatever idea I was obsessing over and teaching me a bit about when to give them up. This lab has been a lovely place to figure out how science works. I am especially grateful to Iryna Yavorska for being my close friend and mentor in my first years here, and to Lucas Ott who has been a constant friend, colleague, and commiserateur. Thank you to my committee members Melissa Baese-Berk, Santiago Jaramillo, and Matt Smear who were willing to go along with this bizarre mash of disciplines and ideas. I, quite literally, would never have reached the stage of completing this dissertation except for the saintlike patience and persistence of Lori Olsen, without whom I would have been summarily removed from the program after missing every deadline. Thank you also to Mindy Kirk who not once but twice was willing to move heaven and earth to help us get our wide-eyed grants in with almost no notice, she is a true testament to how science would simply grind to a halt without those who organize the work. I am so honored to have been able to spend time with so many wonderful people while doing this work: my labmates Aldis Weible, Kip Keller, Nick Sattler, Sam Mehan, Molly Shallow, Tillie Morris, Brynna Paros, Netanya Beard, Rocky Penick, Matt Nardoci, and Alexa Wright; my colleagues and cohortmates particularly Judit Pungor, Anna Lakunina, Sarah Stednitz, Phil Parker, Jo Tomorsky, Joe Wekselblatt, Denver Ncube, Eartha Mae Guthman, Austin Seroka, Rachel Lukowicz, Jackie O'Brien, Dani Cosme, John Flournoy, Cory Costello, Rita Ludwig; and a few of my union cousins and co-conspirators Sam Shepherd, Ellen Kress, Rhi Lindgren, Emily Sutton, and many more that have impacted my life, subtly or not.}

\textit{I would not have made it through grad school without the Janet Smith House and all of the people that I have had the blessing of living with here. There is nothing that has given me hope for the future more than what I have learned in cooperation with you all. It doesn't feel fair to name some and not all of you, but I am sitting at home looking at the wall of your photos and being flooded with memories right now.}

\textit{For the Speech project: thanks to Aldis Weible, Lucas Ott, Conor O'Sullivan, Erik Flister, Kaori Idemaru, Brynna Paros, and all the wonderful people who let me record, chop up, and pitch shift their voices.}

\textit{For the Autopilot project: thanks to Lucas Ott and Tillie Morris for doing most of the behavioral training and being so patient with the bugs, Brynna Paros and Nick Sattler for their help with constructing our behavioral boxes, Chris Rogers who has been brave enough to adopt and contribute to Autopilot in its roughest state, Arne Meyer, Mikkel Roald-Arbøl, and David Robbe who have contributed code and advice, Mackenzie Mathis, Alex Mathis, Gonçalo Lopes, and Gary Kane who collaborated on the DeepLabCut-Live project and provided many a mentorship along the way, Jeremy Delahanty for his inspiring tenacity and humbleness in thinking about better research tools, Matt Smear and Reese Findley for loaning us their Bpod for far longer than they intended to, John Boosinger and the rest of the staff in the machine shop for all their advice and letting me use all their tools, Erik Flister whose Ratrix software inspired some of the design features of Autopilot \citep{meierCollinearFeaturesImpair2011}, Santiago Jaramillo whose \href{https://github.com/sjara/taskontrol}{TASKontrol}\citep{jaramilloTASKontrol2022} gave inspiration for GUI design and served as an early scaffolding to learn Python, my labmates Molly Shallow and Sam Mehan who kept me afloat in my last months of dissertation writing, Rocky Penick for her help strapping Autopilot onto the back of Evan Vickers' mesoscope rig (and Evan for letting us play with his rig)}
