\chapter*{Language Games}

I had intended to finish my dissertation with an experiment that was the next logical conclusion of the mouse model of phonetics, doing longitudinal mesoscopic calcium imaging of auditory cortex as the phonemes were being learned in order to model the changes in network activity. "Interdisciplinary" neuroscience tends to look more like neuroscientists swinging into other disciplines without taking the time to appreciate their complexity, and so this was an attempt at a synthesis of decades of work across several disciplines in order to inform our work. The picture the model attempts to paint is one of a loose basis set of low-level acoustic representations that fluidly restructure themselves according to their recent informational history to achieve a sort of rough categorical consensus around the ill-defined category of a phoneme --- an attempt to move us beyond synthesized speech and trial averaging to naturalistic sounds computed by the dynamic activity negotiated by the brain.

It comes out of chronological order in the spring of 2021, after my work with Autopilot and a covid-induced awakening of the possibility of public engineering with the \href{https://www.peoplesvent.org}{People's Ventilator Project}\citep{lachancePVP1PeopleVentilator2022}. I was restless and not ready to return to basic research while the world was still so broken, and so it was abandoned in favor of the last piece on digital infrastructure. Accordingly, it ends relatively abruptly, without satisfying conclusion. I include it here in its unfinished form, roughly edited, warts and all, as something I intend to pick up perhaps one day when basic science is more possible.
