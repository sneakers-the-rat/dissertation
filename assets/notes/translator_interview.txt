!!! add andrew hoffman to acknowledgements

- need to have some kind of tool-like product

- phases
	- initial funding: gamified it, unlocking different RFAs
	- 

- decisionmaking left up to the teams
	- hackathons and etc. 
	- then eventually more steering
	- didn't know what was possible

? what kind of folks were recruited to build this?
	- mix of science-like folks and ontologists 
	- monarch inititive
		- BIOlink isn't just translator thing, it's also a monarch thing
		- built on Open biomedical ontology

- re data commons
	- wanted to "bring it to its knees"
	- knowledge sources that are clinical data:
		- UNC chapel hill, cohort based, etc.

- user centered working group
	- who is the user? translational scientists, who is that?
	- who are on the user group?
		- PhD student from drexel, explainable AI people in a DARPA sense
			- Hoffman, DARPA school of explainable AI
	- actively not talking about user interface until 5 years later
		- given to a defense contractor through contracting process
	- started as surveying people who might be prospective users.
		- there are answers to these questions... some focus groups... 
		- disconnect between user centered working group and the interface group.

? personalized medicine
	- "augmenting human reasoning"
	- university of alabama birmingham, precision medicine program
		- matt might - son with rare disease
	- sustaiinability committee
		- earthcube/other cyberinfrastructure people influencing 
		? are there explicit ethics people?
			- but no formal ethics team. 
		- thumbs down on ads. 
	- licensing conditions
		- NCATS owns it.

? CoVar
	- maybe something with RENCI overlap
	- patrick (wrote paper on logic of domains?)
	- Eli Lily
		- a few calls with them to compare how their research is doing
	- Google overlap: some people on both sides
		- translator people believe that the google side is fucking up

? Explainability:
	- provanance about sources of evidence and reasoning steps.
	?? is 'translatinig to knowledge' a mischaracterization? 
	?? mixed messaging about how it's intended to be used.
		- definitively not trying to be a question answering system.
		- use tool to navigate complex search space.
		- balance between existing information and novel information.
		- internally, so much skepticism that don't think anyone would believe it's true
		- ultimately a matter of belief about what the tool can do.

- Distributed work structure
	- do people see it as good?

? Reasoners: where did the reasoning model come from?
	- !!GoFi/Blackboard system.
	- Came from initial rounds of hackathons
		- first round got knowledge providers
		- second round funded reasoning agents, but first round got upset because they were also doing reasoning.
		- relay system came later to deal with inconsistencies in stack.


?? Bucher (taina) work on APIs
	- if/then
	- book on facebook. 

? Who gets to contribute data to the translator
	- ideally it would be possible, but wasn't centered, and fell by teh wayside.
