  - Specify some feature, vary it, and test what people say it is
  - If people's perception varies, then it defines the phoneme!
  - Diagram of feature -> perception -> loop back to sound

  - "chairs have four legs" 
  - 6 legged chairs are benches, 2 legged chairs are like.. sandwich boards
  - but having 4 legs isn't enough: is a cat a chair?
  - and something can be a chair with a ton of pointless legs, idk why not
  - overlay haskins lab quote: What features are necessary? none.

      - This isn't the problem that the auditory system faces!
      - It needs to *discover* the features
      - We actually don't *care* about what the features are, we want to know how the auditory system perceives phonemes
      - If we prespecify the features, then we are studying the *features* not the problem
      - We need to preserve the complexity, (figure of inverting the model)
