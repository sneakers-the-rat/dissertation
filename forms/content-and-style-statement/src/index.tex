In the following chapters of my dissertation (all of them), I intend to include published and unpublished co-authored materials (because materials without co-authors are joyless materials\footnote{R.I.P. Hundertwasser})


\section{Phonetic Perception}

\subsection{Mice Can Learn Phonetic Categories}

\begin{leftbar}
\fullcite{saundersMiceCanLearn2019}
\end{leftbar}

In this paper, I designed, programmed, and analyzed the experiment and conducted it in collaboration with my labmate Lucas Ott. The writing was largely mine but importantly guided in many places by my advisor Mike Wehr.

\section{Autopilot}

\subsection{Autopilot: Automating Behavioral Experiments With Lots of Raspberry Pis}

\begin{leftbar}
\fullcite{saundersAutopilotAutomatingBehavioral2019}
\end{leftbar}

I wrote the software, manuscript, designed the figures and experiments, and Mike's help throughout with mentorship and editing was also invaluable. 

\subsection{PVP1 – The People’s Ventilator Project}

\begin{leftbar}
\fullcite{lachancePVP1PeopleVentilator2020}
\end{leftbar}

I designed several major components of the software and its architecture, wrote several sections of the manuscript, and otherwise collaborated with a group of hardware radicals to liberate some knowledge capital. See the contribution statement for more detail.

\subsection{DLC-Live}

\begin{leftbar}
\fullcite{kaneRealtimeLowlatencyClosedloop2020}
\end{leftbar}

I wrote an extension to the Autopilot software mentioned above, and wrote the relevant section of the paper, as well as being part of the group as we conceptualized the project in general.

\section{Infrastructure}

\subsection{Decentralized Infrastructure for (Neuro)science}

\begin{leftbar}
(unpublished)
\end{leftbar}

I have written all of this so far but it is intended as a document with indefinite authorship.
