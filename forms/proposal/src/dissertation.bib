  abstract = {In everyday acoustic environments, we navigate through a maze of sounds that possess a complex spectrotemporal structure, spanning many frequencies and exhibiting temporal modulations that differ within frequency bands. Our auditory system needs to efficiently encode the same sounds in a variety of different contexts, while preserving the ability to separate complex sounds within an acoustic scene. Recent work in auditory neuroscience has made substantial progress in studying how sounds are represented in the auditory system under different contexts, demonstrating that auditory processing of seemingly simple acoustic features, such as frequency and time, is highly dependent on co-occurring acoustic and behavioral stimuli. Through a combination of electrophysiological recordings, computational analysis and behavioral techniques, recent research identified the interactions between external spectral and temporal context of stimuli, as well as the internal behavioral state.},

One approach involves extracting contrastive features from fully-specified minimal pairs. I will show that this approach is provably untenable. A second approach arrives at contrastive specifications by ordering features into a hierarchy, and splitting up the inventory by successive divisions until all phonemes have been distinguished. I will show that this hierarchical approach solves the problems encountered by the minimal-pairs method. Moreover, a hierarchical approach to contrastiveness is implicit in much descriptive phonological practice, and can be found even in the work of theorists who argue against it. Given the centrality of the issue, it is remarkable that it has received almost no attention in the literature. Recovering this missing chapter of phonological theory sheds new light on a number of controversies over contrast in phonology.},

Some theories emphasize linguistic or articulation-based processes in speech-elicited context effects and peripheral (cochlear) auditory perceptual interactions in non-speech-elicited context effects. The present studies challenge this division. Results of three experiments indicate that acoustic histories composed of sine-wave tones drawn from spectral distributions with different mean frequencies robustly affect speech categorization. These context effects were observed even when the acoustic context temporally adjacent to the speech stimulus was held constant and when more than a second of silence or multiple intervening sounds separated the nonlinguistic acoustic context and speech targets. These experiments indicate that speech categorization is sensitive to statistical distributions of spectral information, even if the distributions are composed of nonlinguistic elements. Acoustic context need be neither linguistic nor local to influence speech perception.},

We also provide three options for using this tool with ease: (1) a stand-alone GUI (called DLC-Live! GUI), and integration into (2) Bonsai, and (3) AutoPilot. Lastly, we benchmarked performance on a wide range of systems so that experimentalists can easily decide what hardware is required for their needs.},

Problems concerning appropriate objects of perception (gestures vs. sounds), rate normalization, variance consequent to articulation, and talker normalization are reframed, or even dissolved, within this information-theoretic framework. Application of discriminative models founded on information theory provides a productive approach to answer questions concerning perception of speech, and perception most broadly.},

  abstract = {Infants learn their native language quickly and effortlessly, and follow the same developmental path regardless of culture. However, it has proved difficult to understand how they do this, or to build computers that can reproduce this feat.An early and essential task for infants is to make sense of the speech that they hear. Each language uses a unique set of about 40 phonemes, and infants must learn to partition varied speech sounds into these phonemic categories. Young infants are sensitive to subtle differences between all phonetic units, whereas older children lose their sensitivity to distinctions that are not used in their native language. The loss of discrimination for foreign-language distinctions is paralleled by an increase in sensitivity to native-language phonetic units.There is evidence that infants analyse the statistical distributions of sounds that they hear in ambient language, and use this information to form phonemic categories. They also learn phonotactic rules — language-specific rules that govern the sequences of phonemes that can be used to compose words.To identify word boundaries, infants can use both transitional probabilities between syllables, and prosodic cues, which relate to linguistic stress. Most languages are dominated by either trochaic words (with the stress on the first syllable) or iambic ones (with the stress on later syllables). Infants seem to use a combination of statistical and prosodic cues to segment words in speech.Social influences are important in speech learning. Infants learn more easily from interactions with human beings speaking another language than they do from audiovisual exposure to the same language material, and their speech is strongly influenced by the response of others around them, such as their mothers. The importance of social input in language learning has some similarities to social influences on song learning in birds.Language experience causes neural changes. One hypothesis, native language neural commitment (NLNC), proposes that language learning produces dedicated neural networks that code the patterns of native-language speech. As these networks develop, they make it easier for new speech elements and patterns to be learned if they are consistent with the existing patterns, but place constraints on the learning of foreign-language patterns. NLNC might explain the closing of the 'sensitive period' for language learning; once a certain amount of learning has occurred, neural commitment interferes with the learning of new languages so they cannot be learned as easily.},

Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We designed a task for head-fixed mice that combines established assays of perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path towards achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.},

We search for IVC and HVC in HST high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of 55 halo stars at vertical heights \$|z| \textbackslash gtrsim 1\$ kpc. We show that IVCs (\$40 \textbackslash leq |v\_\{\textbackslash rm LSR\}| {$<$}90\$ km/s) have a high detection rate - the covering factor, \$f\_c\$ - that is about constant (\$f\_c =0.90\textbackslash pm 0.04\$) from \$z=1.5\$ to \$14\$ kpc, implying IVCs are essentially confined to \$|z|\textbackslash lesssim 1.5\$ kpc. For the HVCs (\$90 \textbackslash leq |v\_\{\textbackslash rm LSR\}| \textbackslash lesssim 170\$ km/s), we find \$f\_c\$ increases from \$f\_c \textbackslash simeq 0.14\textbackslash pm 0.10\$ at \$|z|\textbackslash lesssim 2-3\$ kpc to \$f\_c =0.60\textbackslash pm 0.15\$ at \$5\textbackslash lesssim |z|\textbackslash lesssim 14\$ kpc, the latter value being similar to that found towards QSOs. In contrast, the covering factor of very high-velocity clouds (VHVCs, \$|v\_\{\textbackslash rm LSR\}|\textbackslash gtrsim 170\$ km/s) is \$f\_c{$<$}4\textbackslash\%\$ in the stellar sample compared to 20\textbackslash\% in a QSO sample, implying these clouds must be at \$d\textbackslash gtrsim 10-15\$ kpc (\$|z|\textbackslash gtrsim 10\$ kpc). Gas clouds with \$|v\_\{\textbackslash rm LSR\}|{$>$}40\$ km/s at \$|b|\textbackslash gtrsim 15\^\textbackslash circ\$ have therefore \$|v\_\{\textbackslash rm LSR\}|\$ decreasing with decreasing \$|z|\$. Assuming each feature originates from a single cloud, we derive scale-heights of \$1.0 \textbackslash pm 0.3\$ and \$2.8 \textbackslash pm 0.3\$ kpc for the IVCs and HVCs, respectively. Our findings provide support to the "rain" and galactic fountain models. In the latter scenario, VHVCs may mostly serve as fuel for the MW halo. In view of their locations and high covering factors, IVCs and HVCs are good candidates to sustain star formation in the MW.},

  abstract = {A motor theory of speech perception, initially proposed to account for results of early experiments with synthetic speech, is now extensively revised to accommodate recent findings, and to relate the assumptions of the theory to those that might be made about other perceptual modes. According to the revised theory, phonetic information is perceived in a biologically distinct system, a ‘module’ specialized to detect the intended gestures of the speaker that are the basis for phonetic categories. Built into the structure of this module is the unique but lawful relationship between the gestures and the acoustic patterns in which they are variously overlapped. In consequence, the module causes perception of phonetic structure without translation from preliminary auditory impressions. Thus, it is comparable to such other modules as the one that enables an animal to localize sound. Peculiar to the phonetic module are the relation between perception and production it incorporates and the fact that it must compete with other modules for the same stimulus variations. Une théorie motrice de la perception proposée initialement pour rendre compte des résultats des premières expériences avec de la parole synthétique a été largement révisée afin d'interpréter les données récentes et de relier les propositions de cette théorie à celles que l'on peut faire pour d'autres modalités de perception. La révision de cette théorie stipule que l'information phonétique est fournie par un système biologique distinct, un ‘module’ spécialisé pour détecter les gestes que le locuteur a eu l'intention de faire: ces gestes fondent les catégories phonétiques. La relation entre les gestes et les patterns acoustiques dans lesquels ceux-ci sont imbriqués de facon variée est unique mais régulée. Cette relation est construite dans la structure du module. En conséquence le module provoque la perception de la structure phonétique sans traduction à partir d'impressions auditives préliminaires. Ce module est ainsi comparable à d'autres modules tels que celui qui permet à l'animal de localiser les sons. La particularité de ce module tient à la relation entre perception et production qu'il incorpore et an fait qu'il doit rivaliser avec d'autres modules pour de mêmes variations de stimulus.},

Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies, humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with computer-based tracking, but markers are intrusive, and the number and location of the markers must be determined a priori. Here we present an efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors. Remarkably, even when only a small number of frames are labeled (\textasciitilde 200), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.},

  abstract = {This essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing, with special attention to the example of Elsevier. A scholarly publisher can be defined as a surveillance publisher if it derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from prediction products, fueled by data extracted from researcher behavior. The essay begins by tracing the Google search engine’s roots in bibliometrics, alongside a history of the citation analysis company that became, in 2016, Clarivate. The point is to show the co-evolution of scholarly communication and the surveillance advertising economy. The essay then refines the idea of surveillance publishing by engaging with the work of Shoshana Zuboff, Jathan Sadowski, Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, and Aziz Huq. The recent history of Elsevier is traced to describe the company’s research-lifecycle data-harvesting strategy, with the aim to develop and sell prediction products to universities and other customers. The essay concludes by considering some of the potential costs of surveillance publishing, as other big commercial publishers increasingly enter the predictive-analytics mark. It is likely, I argue, that windfall subscription-and-APC profits in Elsevier’s “legacy” publishing business have financed its decade-long acquisition binge in analytics, with the implication that university customers are budgetary victims twice over. The products’ purpose, I stress, is to streamline the top-down assessment and evaluation practices that have taken hold in recent decades, in tandem with the view that the university’s main purpose is to grow regional and national economies. A final pair of concerns is that publishers’ prediction projects may camouflage and perpetuate existing biases in the system—and that scholars may internalize an analytics mindset, one already encouraged by citation counts and impact factors.},

  abstract = {Six experiments explored the hypothesis that the members of categories which are considered most prototypical are those with most attributes in common with other members of the category and least attributes in common with other categories. In probabilistic terms, the hypothesis is that prototypicality is a function of the total cue validity of the attributes of items. In Experiments 1 and 3, subjects listed attributes for members of semantic categories which had been previously rated for degree of prototypicality. High positive correlations were obtained between those ratings and the extent of distribution of an item's attributes among the other items of the category. In Experiments 2 and 4, subjects listed superordinates of category members and listed attributes of members of contrasting categories. Negative correlations were obtained between prototypicality and superordinates other than the category in question and between prototypicality and an item's possession of attributes possessed by members of contrasting categories. Experiments 5 and 6 used artificial categories and showed that family resemblance within categories and lack of overlap of elements with contrasting categories were correlated with ease of learning, reaction time in identifying an item after learning, and rating of prototypicality of an item. It is argued that family resemblance offers an alternative to criterial features in defining categories.},

  abstract = {Research in psychology tends to reflect, sometimes self-consciously, prevailing philosophical viewpoints. Categorization is the area in cognitive psychology which deals with the ancient problem of universals, that is, with the fact that unique particular objects or events can be treated equivalently. Prior to the 1970s, categorization research tended to mirror the simplified worlds described in early Wittgenstein and in logical positivism. However, Wittgenstein’s later philosophy has revolutionary implications for many aspects of human thought, among them issues in categorization. In this paper, I will argue that modern research in natural categories is actually derived from Wittgensteinian insights, but ambivalently so: It has tended to work with the symptoms rather than the root of his challenge.},

Currently available tools strongly limit the complexity and reproducibility of experiments. Here we introduce Autopilot, a complete, open-source Python framework for behavioral neuroscience that distributes experiments over networked swarms of Raspberry Pis. Autopilot enables qualitatively greater experimental flexibility by allowing arbitrary numbers of hardware components to be combined in arbitrary experimental designs. Research is made reproducible by documenting all data and task design parameters in a human-readable and publishable format at the time of collection. Autopilot provides an order-of-magnitude performance improvement over existing tools while also being an order of magnitude less costly to implement. Autopilot’s flexible, scalable architecture allows neuroscientists to design the next generation of experiments to investigate the behaving brain.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Speech sound contrasts differ along multiple phonetic dimensions. During speech perception, listeners must decide which cues are relevant, and determine the relative importance of each cue, while also integrating other, signal-external cues. The comparison of cue weighting in perception and production bears on a range of theoretical issues including the processes underlying sound change, the time course of learning, the nature of cues, and the perception-production interface. Research examining the relative alignment of cue weighting across the modalities, on both a community and individual level, has revealed both parallels and asymmetries between the modalities. The extraordinarily wide range of ways that have been used to conceptualize and quantify cue weights reflects the inherent theoretical, methodological, and analytical differences between the two modalities. More consideration of the choices of analytical metrics, explicit discussion of the theoretical assumptions that underlie them, and systematic investigations of different types of cues will lead to more generalizable findings that can be incorporated into computational implementable models of speech processing.

Hand-tuned PID controllers and similar variants have comprised the industry standard for decades, yet can behave poorly by over- or under-shooting their target or oscillating rapidly. We consider a data-driven machine learning approach: First, we train a simulator based on data we collect from an artificial lung. Then, we train deep neural network controllers on these simulators.We show that our controllers are able to track target pressure waveforms significantly better than PID controllers. We further show that a learned controller generalizes across lungs with varying characteristics much more readily than PID controllers do.},

We revisit Marr’s levels-of-analysis framework, which has been remarkably productive and useful for cognitive psychological explanation. We discuss ways in which Marr’s framework may be extended to other areas of psychology, such as social, developmental, and evolutionary psychology, bringing new benefits to these fields. We then show how theoretical analyses can endow a theory with minimal plausibility even before contact with empirical data: We call this the theoretical cycle. Finally, we explain how our proposal may contribute to addressing critical issues in psychological science, including how to leverage effects to understand capacities better.},

  abstract = {This article describes an emergent logic of accumulation in the networked sphere, ‘surveillance capitalism,’ and considers its implications for ‘information civilization.’ The institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: ‘data extraction and analysis,’ ‘new contractual forms due to better monitoring,’ ‘personalization and customization,’ and ‘continuous experiments.’ An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: ‘Big Other.’ It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},
