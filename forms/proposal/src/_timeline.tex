\textbf{ToC \& TODO Timeline}

Each of the three chapters of my dissertation are largely written, and so the remaining work is mostly revising and compiling into a single document. Building the behavioral apparatus for the remaining speech experiment is an extension of my prior art. My goal is to defend at the end of the Spring term, or early in the Summer term if extra time is needed.

Writing always takes me longer than I anticipate it will, but I am determined to not make perfection the enemy of the good in this case, and have set July 1st as a hard deadline where I will cut the process and submit what I have for your evaluation.

Development of the speech task could also run long, but that is something that I'm capable of working on in parallel to writing, and since it relies on relatively mature parts of autopilot as well as previously published designs from the IBL\cite{laboratoryStandardizedReproducibleMeasurement2020a}, I am confident it's achievable within this timeline.
