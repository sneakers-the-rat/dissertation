# Overview

(Don't need to actually include in the defense, but just for the sake of meta-organization...)

- Speech model (bring down to 5-7m)
	- Statement of problem
		- phonemes are an ill-defined acoustic category
		- use Wittgenstein "games" as a model
	- Describe cue-based paradigm
	- Invert problem: motivate natural speech
	- Briefly describe mouse results
	- Expand problem: graph of related components, why is this so hard to do?
		- why are there *disciplines* at all? why is it that our interdisciplinary collaborations don't really structurally challenge either 

- Infocapitalism 101 (5-7m)
	- The journals reflect the dominant mode of information capitalism: surveillance platforms
	- This structures the rest of the infrastructural problem
	- So we can't treat any of the pieces in isolation, but have to consider it altogether
	
- Data (10m)
	- what do decentralized data curation systems look like? they look like pirate sites.
	- p2p
	- linked data

- Tools (20m)
	- Autopilot stuff here
	- Experimental Frameworks

- Knowledge (10m)
	- Knowledge organization is the crux of the scientific problem
		- DOI example, as well as publisher business model
	- How to link documents, communication systems, wikis, etc.

- Conclusion...

- History on the internet
		- Ed Horowitz, CEO of Viacom, 1996: "The internet has yet to fulfill its promise of commercial success"
		- Tim O'Reilly "Web 2.0" "The key to competitive advantage in internet applications is the extent to which users add their own data to that which you provide"
		- Transformation from direct peer interactions via protocols into platforms: everything routes through the platform. 
		- The centralized routing creates data, and that becomes the primary product: multisided markets that sell ad targeting to customers, etc.
	- tell this using the story of google?
		- initially, the web self-organized: you were intended to have your own set of bookmarks hosted on your website, and then use that and links to your friends to find things. [eg. the wiki bus lines]
		- google crawled this and made a derivative product based on analyzing the links between other pages
		- then started selling ads...
		- [cognitive effects of search vs. organization] 
	- Divide this problem into three: data, tools, and knowledge.
		- relate to storage, compute, and communication.
	- In science, this was designed:
		- brief history of digital science
		- pubmed central & DOIs
