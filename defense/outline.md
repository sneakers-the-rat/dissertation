# Overview

(Don't need to actually include in the defense, but just for the sake of meta-organization...)

- Speech model (bring down to 5-7m)
	- Statement of problem
		- phonemes are an ill-defined acoustic category
		- use Wittgenstein "games" as a model
	- Describe cue-based paradigm
	- Invert problem: motivate natural speech
	- Briefly describe mouse results
	- Expand problem: graph of related components, why is this so hard to do?
		- why are there *disciplines* at all? why is it that our interdisciplinary collaborations don't really structurally challenge either 

- Infocapitalism 101 (5-7m)
	- The journals reflect the dominant mode of information capitalism: surveillance platforms
	- This structures the rest of the infrastructural problem
	- So we can't treat any of the pieces in isolation, but have to consider it altogether
	
- Data (10m)
	- what do decentralized data curation systems look like? they look like pirate sites.
	- p2p
	- linked data

- Tools (20m)
	- Autopilot stuff here
	- Experimental Frameworks

- Knowledge (10m)
	- Knowledge organization is the crux of the scientific problem
		- DOI example, as well as publisher business model
	- How to link documents, communication systems, wikis, etc.

- Conclusion...
	- We have to think about this as a sort of cognitive rhythm imposed by our relationship with infrastructural technology. 
	- Why is it that we process information serially, that there is such a thing as a 'news cycle,' that it might be possible to miss a very relevant idea when you're looking for it specifically.
	- The same processes that make it so that we can't make sense of our scientific results are the same systems that make it impossible to organize an effective climate resistance, abolition movement, or properly anticapital organizations at a time when all three are literally killing us all.

- History on the internet
		- Ed Horowitz, CEO of Viacom, 1996: "The internet has yet to fulfill its promise of commercial success"
		- Tim O'Reilly "Web 2.0" "The key to competitive advantage in internet applications is the extent to which users add their own data to that which you provide"
		- Transformation from direct peer interactions via protocols into platforms: everything routes through the platform. 
		- The centralized routing creates data, and that becomes the primary product: multisided markets that sell ad targeting to customers, etc.
	- tell this using the story of google?
		- initially, the web self-organized: you were intended to have your own set of bookmarks hosted on your website, and then use that and links to your friends to find things. [eg. the wiki bus lines]
		- google crawled this and made a derivative product based on analyzing the links between other pages
		- then started selling ads...
		- [cognitive effects of search vs. organization] 
	- Divide this problem into three: data, tools, and knowledge.
		- relate to storage, compute, and communication.
	- In science, this was designed:

		- pubmed central & DOIs
