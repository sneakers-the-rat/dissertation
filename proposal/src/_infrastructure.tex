Through my work in Autopilot I became acutely aware of the social dynamics that define infrastructural development. While there is subconscious belief that scientific technology will get, in fits and starts, "better" over time, instead it became abundantly obvious that without specific and strategic intervention, scientific infrastructure is bound to a fate that drains scientific funding and binds every bit of the practice of science to a few massive information conglomerates. 

> Research on publisher propaganda networks and capture initiatives

> Field work on researching wiki communities and finding the alt-tech world that is building a better future outside the eyes of the corporate internet.

> Listening to the social scientists about the intrinsic intersection between social and technological systems.

> The "experiment" so to speak is whether it is possible to organize a group of scientists to develop anti-profitable technology and overcome the incentive systems that drive us into serfdom. I will be publicly releasing this and trying a new kind of public contribution
