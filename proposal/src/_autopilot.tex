\section{Autopilot}
\label{sec:autopilot}

In our struggle through implementing the speech discrimination task, I learned that the state of neuroscientific behavioral tooling was a few incomplete and rigid packages, but otherwise almost entirely lab-specific code such as that I had experienced. Autopilot is my contribution to that problem\footnote{not sure in which direction...} \cite{saundersAutopilotAutomatingBehavioral2019}.
