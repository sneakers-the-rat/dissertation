I see myself as a transdisciplinary researcher: sprawled across worlds, but following a common thread. The closest I've come to a simple description of my focus is \textit{communicative systems}: how agents or components interact to create systems of meaning that, reciprocally, structure their interaction. I also believe that the practice of science itself is deeply political, reflective of the systems of belief and power interacting across interlocking institutions and organizations, and have increasingly oriented my work towards understanding and directly counteracting the ways that neoliberalization and commercial capture of science poison every part of our work.

This dissertation will be in three parts, roughly tracing the development of my thoughts over the past seven years. My work here starts and ends with studying a mouse model of \hyperref[sec:phonemes]{auditory phonetic perception}, comprising behavioral neuroscience, an attempted merger of several strains of linguistic, philosophical, and neuroscientific thought, and in the final few months a touch of neurophysiology. That led, perhaps unwisely, to the development of \hyperref[sec:autopilot]{Autopilot}: a Python framework for behavioral neuroscientific experiments based in distributed computing, but learning lessons from history and critical technology scholars is mutating into something more like a technical knowledge organization system. Finally in my last year my work has focused on the broader \hyperref[sec:infrastructure]{infrastructure and practice} of science, and weaving between many fields have tried to plot a course away from the subjugation of basic science to surveillance and information capitalism.
