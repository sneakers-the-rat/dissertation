## Dissertation

### HTML

(coming soon) :)

### PDF

**22-08-10:** Pending a final, archival version I am making the versioned repository render of the dissertation public. Mind the version hash and render date :). This link is likely to change.
- [swarmpunk - repository version]({{ "/assets/swarmpunk_repo.pdf" | relative_url }})

### Source

The repository for the dissertation, this site, and the slides, can be found at:

[https://github.com/sneakers-the-rat/dissertation](https://github.com/sneakers-the-rat/dissertation)

Though this is likely to change as I move my personal work off of GitHub <3
